UK SME Cybersecurity Compliance Landscape
Introduction: SME Cybersecurity Obligations in the UK
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK face increasing cybersecurity obligations driven
by government mandates and industry standards. Key drivers include the government-backed Cyber
Essentials scheme, the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Regulations, and evolving guidance
for critical infrastructure protection. For example, Cyber Essentials (a set of five basic security controls)
has become a de-facto minimum standard – it is even required for vendors handling certain sensitive
data in UK government contracts
. Meanwhile, the NIS Regulations 2018 impose cybersecurity and
breach-reporting duties on operators of essential services and certain digital service providers
.
Upcoming updates (inspired by the EU’s NIS2 Directive) are expected to broaden these requirements to
more sectors and mid-sized companies, further raising the compliance bar. Beyond these, SMEs must
also heed data protection security requirements (UK GDPR) and industry-specific advisories from the
National Cyber Security Centre (e.g. the Cyber Assessment Framework for critical sectors). In short, UK
SMEs are under growing pressure to implement governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) measures
to manage cyber risks and demonstrate resilience.
Meeting these obligations can be challenging for resource-constrained businesses. This has fueled a
market for tools and services that help SMEs achieve compliance – from attaining Cyber Essentials
certification to maintaining ongoing security controls aligned with regulations. Below, we survey the
competitive landscape of UK companies (and international players active in the UK) offering such tools
and facilities. We’ll cover their offerings, pricing models, market presence, and other relevant info,
followed by a summary comparison table.
Key Compliance Frameworks & Requirements for UK SMEs
(Context)
Before comparing vendors, it’s useful to understand the main frameworks/mandates in play:
Cyber Essentials (CE) – A UK Government-backed certification with two levels (basic and Plus). It
specifies 5 technical controls (firewalls, secure configuration, access control, malware protection,
patch management)
. CE certification is valid for 12 months
 and is increasingly seen
as a minimum cybersecurity badge. Many SMEs pursue CE to boost trust and because it’s
mandated for certain government supply chain contracts
. CE Plus adds an independent audit
of those controls. 
NIS Regulations – UK law (since 2018) implementing the EU NIS Directive, focused on operators
of essential services (energy, water, transport, health, etc.) and certain digital service providers. It
requires robust cyber risk management, incident reporting, and auditing by regulators
.
While targeted at critical infrastructure (often larger firms), some medium-sized suppliers and IT
service providers to those sectors may also fall in scope. The NIS regime is being updated; NIS2
(an EU update) broadens the sectors and lowers size thresholds – the UK is expected to introduce
similar enhancements to cover more “important” entities by 2024–2025. This means more mid-
size companies (including some SMEs) will need to formalize their cybersecurity GRC (policies,
risk assessments, controls, incident response plans, etc.). 
Governance and Advisory Frameworks – Aside from formal mandates, SMEs often choose to
adopt standards like  ISO/IEC 27001 (information security management) or follow NCSC best
practices (such as the 10 Steps to Cyber Security or the NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework for
essential services). While not laws, these help meet obligations (e.g. ISO 27001 certification can
demonstrate good practice to regulators or partners). The UK government’s Cyber Essentials is
essentially a subset of such controls, aimed at basic cyber hygiene
. Additionally, sectors have
specific  guidance  (e.g.  the  NHS  DSP  Toolkit  for  healthcare,  or  the  Telecom  Security  Act
requirements for telecom providers). SMEs that provide critical products or services must keep
an eye on these evolving advisories.
In summary, UK SMEs today may need to  certify or demonstrate compliance with one or multiple
frameworks to satisfy legal requirements or customer expectations. This has led to a range of solution
providers that help businesses manage policies, implement controls, monitor compliance continuously,
and pass audits/certifications.
Competitive Landscape: Compliance Solution Providers for UK
SMEs
A number of companies offer software tools or integrated services to help UK SMEs achieve cyber
security compliance and governance objectives. These range from local UK startups focusing on SME
needs, to global Software-as-a-Service platforms, to traditional enterprise GRC (Governance, Risk &
Compliance)  systems  (often  overkill  for  SMEs).  Below  we  detail  the  major  players,  including  their
offerings, target market, pricing approach, and any available market share or usage indicators:
CyberSmart (UK) – Cyber Essentials Compliance Made Easy
CyberSmart is a London-based company purpose-built for SMEs’ compliance needs. Founded in
2017 through a GCHQ accelerator, it provides an all-in-one platform that streamlines Cyber Essentials
certification  and  continuous  security  monitoring
.  CyberSmart’s  cloud  platform  deploys
lightweight agents on endpoints to continuously scan for security issues (unpatched software, config
changes, etc.) and reports to a dashboard
. It flags what needs fixing to meet the Cyber Essentials
controls and even offers in-app guidance or consultant support (via partners) to remediate gaps
.
Uniquely, CyberSmart can facilitate “same-day” Cyber Essentials certification online – they are an IASME-
approved certification body, so businesses can get certified quickly through the app
. The solution
also bundles perks like cyber insurance (e.g. £25k coverage) for certified customers as an added
incentive
.
Pricing model: CyberSmart is sold as a SaaS subscription, priced by company size (number of devices/
users). It’s very SME-friendly: starting at around £49 per month for small organizations
, with tiers
scaling upward for larger user counts (e.g. ~£90/month for 1–9 users in a bundle that includes CE
certification and the Active Protect monitoring service
). This low entry price makes it affordable
for micro and small businesses. (The Cyber Essentials certification fee itself is included in such bundles,
which is notable since a basic CE assessment alone typically costs ~£300+VAT for micro companies via
IASME
.)
Market share and usage: CyberSmart has gained significant traction in the UK SME market – as of
early 2023 it was reported to be protecting over 4,000 small businesses in the UK
. Many of these
are at the 10–50 employee size. The company has also partnered with managed service providers
(MSPs) and insurance firms to reach more customers, indicating a strategy of scaling through channels
. With a Series B funding in 2023, CyberSmart is expanding internationally, but the UK remains
its core market. Given ~51,000 total Cyber Essentials certificates were issued in the year to mid-2025
, CyberSmart’s user base suggests a substantial share of SMEs are opting for its platform (either
directly or via consultants) to achieve and maintain certification.
Key differentiators: Simplicity and specialization for Cyber Essentials. CyberSmart combines an easy
app  (no  prior  security  expertise  needed)  with  compliance-as-a-service.  It  continuously  monitors
compliance post-certification to ensure the SME stays secure
. This ongoing aspect plus included
insurance set it apart from one-off consulting. In essence, CyberSmart is positioned as an affordable
“compliance on autopilot” tool for UK small businesses.
Drata (US) – Automated GRC Platform with UK Framework Support
Drata is a well-known U.S.-based security compliance automation platform that expanded into the
UK market. It started by automating frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001 for cloud startups, and in
September 2023 Drata added support for the UK Cyber Essentials scheme
. This means Drata’s
platform now has built-in mappings and controls for CE’s requirements, allowing UK companies to use
Drata  to  prepare  for  certification.  Drata  provides  continuous  control  monitoring,  automated
evidence  collection,  policy  templates,  and  an  auditor  collaboration  portal
 –  essentially
replacing spreadsheets and reducing the manual workload of compliance. Notably, it can  monitor
compliance  with  CE  controls  on  an  ongoing  basis (e.g.  checking  that  patching  is  up  to  date,
passwords meet criteria, etc.), which helps ensure the organization remains compliant year-round
.
For the more advanced  Cyber Essentials Plus, Drata offers guidance but that level still requires an
independent audit outside the tool
.
Pricing model: Drata is offered as an annual SaaS subscription, typically priced based on the number of
employees  and  which  compliance  frameworks  are  needed.  Exact  pricing  isn’t  public  (quotes  are
custom), but it is generally at a higher price point than basic tools – more in line with the value of saving
auditor time and combining multiple compliance standards. Many tech SMEs report Drata (and similar
rivals) often start in the low  five-figure range annually for a small company, covering a couple of
frameworks. Drata emphasizes the ROI by claiming automation saves time and costs (e.g. avoiding the
need for dedicated compliance staff or costly audit prep). If a company already uses Drata for ISO 27001
or SOC2, adding Cyber Essentials is streamlined, since Drata will cross-map overlapping controls so
no duplicate effort is needed
.
Market  presence: Drata  has  grown  rapidly  worldwide  –  by  late  2023  it  served  “thousands  of
customers across 50 countries”
. Its client base tends to be tech-oriented SMEs (e.g. software
companies) and mid-market firms who need multiple certifications. In the UK, Drata’s formal launch of
Cyber Essentials support and an expanding EMEA team indicate a push into the UK/EU region. Given its
strong funding and recognition (often named alongside Vanta as a leader in automated compliance),
Drata is becoming a significant competitor for any UK company considering an all-in-one compliance
platform rather than local point solutions.
Competitors: Drata’s main competitors in this space are  Vanta, Secureframe, and Hyperproof –
among these, Vanta has also targeted UK compliance specifically (see below). Compared to some UK-
specific solutions, Drata is more comprehensive (covering dozens of frameworks) but might be more
than what a micro-business strictly needs for just Cyber Essentials. It shines for SMEs that anticipate
needing international standards (ISO, SOC2, GDPR, etc.) in addition to UK-specific ones.
Vanta (US) – Expanding into UK Standards (Cyber Essentials, NIS2)
Vanta is another leading compliance automation vendor from the U.S., very similar in concept to Drata.
Notably, Vanta has made a strong entry into the UK market by announcing support for  UK Cyber
Essentials and CE Plus requirements. In fact, Vanta’s website touts itself as “the fastest way to
achieve UK Cyber Essentials compliance,” automating up to 70% of the work via built-in controls and
monitoring
. Like Drata, Vanta connects with a company’s systems (cloud platforms, device
management, etc.) to continuously check security settings against the required standards. It provides
integration-driven checks, auto-generated policies, and test evidence to simplify passing an audit
. Vanta also highlights that if an organization is already compliant with another framework (say ISO
27001 or SOC 2), it will automatically map those controls to Cyber Essentials, avoiding duplicated
work
. This is useful for SMEs that expand their compliance obligations over time.
Pricing model: Vanta’s pricing is also annual SaaS, generally tied to employee count (since they monitor
endpoints and accounts). While not public, it typically has tiered packages (e.g. for startups vs mid-
market). Reviews indicate Vanta’s cost is comparable to Drata. For a small business focusing only on CE,
Vanta’s offering may be more expensive than a local UK-only solution like CyberSmart, but the value is
in  covering  multiple  frameworks  in  one  platform.  Vanta  often  markets  heavily  to  startups  by
emphasizing scalability – as a company grows, they can add on more standards in Vanta’s interface (the
platform supports 25+ frameworks including SOC 2, ISO, NIS2, GDPR, etc. as of 2025
).
Market presence: Vanta claims to have  thousands of customers globally as well
. It’s especially
popular among cloud-native companies and has been expanding in Europe (they have an EU data
center to accommodate GDPR concerns). While exact UK customer counts aren’t disclosed, Vanta’s
inclusion of Cyber Essentials and NIS2 indicates a strategic focus on European markets. The company
has substantial funding (unicorn valuation) and has been recognized in the 2025 Forbes Cloud 100
,
signaling strong momentum. We can expect Vanta to be in direct competition with Drata for any UK
SME that might need a multi-framework compliance automation solution.
DataGuard (Germany/UK) – “Compliance-as-a-Service” with Human Expertise
DataGuard is a European provider (headquartered in Germany, with a London office) that takes a
hybrid approach: an all-in-one compliance platform coupled with expert consulting support. This
“compliance-as-a-service” model is designed for SMEs that want to outsource much of the complexity.
DataGuard’s platform covers a wide range of frameworks – from ISO 27001 and GDPR to NIS2, SOC 2,
TISAX, and even the EU Whistleblowing Directive
. It offers modules for information security
management (ISMS), data privacy management, vendor risk, etc., all integrated. A key feature is its
iterative risk management dashboard where companies can document assets, risks, and controls,
and track improvements. DataGuard automates evidence collection and control monitoring to ensure
continuous compliance (they claim to cut manual effort by ~40% and speed up certifications by 75%)
. In parallel, each client gets access to DataGuard’s in-house consultants and subject matter experts
for guidance – effectively augmenting the software with on-demand advisory.
Pricing model: DataGuard is sold in fixed-price packages tailored to the company’s needs
. They
emphasize transparent pricing, though actual figures aren’t publicly listed as a simple price sheet. In
practice, many DataGuard customers pay an annual subscription in the low-to-mid five figures (GBP)
which includes the software platform and a set amount of consultation hours or support services. For
example, a package might include the ISMS software plus help from a named consultant to achieve ISO
27001 certification over several months. This can be cost-effective compared to hiring a full-time
compliance officer or engaging a big law firm
. DataGuard often positions itself as giving “the best of
both worlds – specialist advice plus time-saving technology”
Market presence: DataGuard has grown quickly with this model; as of 2023 they reported  4,000+
companies  using  their  platform
.  Initially  many  clients  were  using  DataGuard  for  GDPR/data
protection compliance (they launched in 2017 in the wake of GDPR). Now they have expanded their
security offerings, and notably they’ve been marketing NIS2 compliance solutions in 2024-2025 as that
becomes a hot topic in Europe
. In the UK, DataGuard’s customer base includes lots of SMEs and
mid-market firms that lack internal compliance teams. Their partnership with investors like British
Patient Capital (UK government’s fund) also raised their profile. While DataGuard competes with pure
software platforms, its blend of human+tech service is fairly unique. It likely appeals to organizations
that want more hands-on guidance or “outsourced compliance officer” services in addition to software.
Use cases: An SME might use DataGuard to achieve ISO 27001 certification (with DataGuard guiding
them step-by-step and providing audit support), maintain a privacy compliance program, and prepare
for upcoming NIS2 regulations – all via one vendor. This breadth can be attractive for companies that
have to juggle multiple compliance obligations at once.
SureCloud (UK) – Integrated GRC Platform with SME Packages
SureCloud is a UK-based Governance, Risk & Compliance software provider that has been in the
market for about 15+ years. Traditionally, SureCloud’s platform has been used by larger organizations
for  risk  management,  compliance  tracking,  and  penetration  testing  services.  Recently,  however,
SureCloud introduced a “Foundations” GRC package aimed at small teams and growing businesses,
to make their solution more accessible. SureCloud’s platform is a no-code, modular GRC system – it
provides applications for Compliance Management, Risk Management, Third-Party Risk, Internal Audit,
Incident Management, etc., all unified in one cloud interface
. For compliance, it includes pre-
mapped content for various frameworks; out-of-the-box it supports common standards such as  ISO
27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and even newer ones like DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) and NIS2
.  SureCloud  emphasizes  automation  of  tasks  like  evidence  collection,  control  monitoring,  and
reporting (they advertise up to 75% reduction in manual effort, similar to peers)
.
Pricing model: Unlike some competitors that charge per user, SureCloud’s SME-focused offering is sold
as a package with a flat price for a certain scope. It’s reportedly starting around £15k per year for the
“Foundations” edition (supporting a small compliance team with unlimited users) – significantly cheaper
than their enterprise deployments, but still a sizable investment for a smaller SME. The company
provides  custom  quotes  and  even  a  downloadable  pricing  brochure  for  transparency
.
Essentially, SureCloud is positioning this as a mid-tier solution: more robust than lightweight tools, but
with a cost and complexity still within reach of midsize businesses. For very small companies, £15k+
may be too high, but for, say, a 200-employee firm that needs a solid GRC system, it’s an attractive
proposition.
Market presence: SureCloud is a recognized name in the UK GRC space (featured in Gartner’s Magic
Quadrant for IT Risk Management, etc.). Their clients have included enterprises in financial services,
retail, and so on. By launching the Foundations product, they are trying to capture the upper-SME and
mid-market segment. They highlight case studies like Specsavers and AutoTrader using SureCloud for
risk and compliance management
. While those are large companies, the same platform now being
scaled down means SMEs can trust that it’s a mature solution. In terms of market share, SureCloud isn’t
as ubiquitous among SMEs as the smaller specialist tools (it’s more commonly seen in organizations
with dedicated compliance teams). But it provides a path for SMEs that want to invest in a long-term
GRC infrastructure that can grow with them.
Notable features: SureCloud offers a unified platform approach – an SME can start with compliance
management (e.g. manage their ISO 27001 or Cyber Essentials controls in the tool), and later expand to
use it for vendor risk assessments, business continuity planning, etc., all within the same system. It also
boasts strong  customizability without coding, meaning as the business evolves, the tool can be
configured to new requirements without expensive development. This flexibility and the “single source
of truth” concept (all risk and compliance data in one place) are major selling points
.
ISMS.online (UK) – Cloud Platform for ISO 27001 and More
ISMS.online (often stylized as ISMS.online or simply “IO”) is a UK-based SaaS platform that focuses on
helping organizations implement and run an  Information Security Management System (ISMS). It
started primarily as an ISO 27001 support tool but has expanded to cover multiple frameworks. For
SMEs, ISMS.online provides a structured environment to “kickstart your journey to compliance” with
pre-built content and guidance
. Out of the box, it includes what they call Headstart content –
essentially template policies, controls, and an ISO 27001/other standard mapping that gives you an
“81% head start” on documentation
. There’s also an Assured Results methodology (step-by-step
project plan to achieve certification) and a Virtual Coach feature to guide users through tasks
. The
platform supports multiple standards; you can choose one or multiple from a list that includes  ISO
27001, ISO 27701 (privacy), ISO 22301 (business continuity), ISO 9001 (quality), GDPR, NIS2, DORA,
etc.
. This makes it quite comprehensive for an SME-oriented product.
Pricing model: ISMS.online uses a subscription model with tiered plans, but all pricing is bespoke via
quotes. They explicitly state that the pricing is flexible based on the customer’s objectives, scope, and
number of users – so you only pay for what you need
. In practice, an SME might purchase a
single-framework package (e.g. ISO 27001 compliance package) at a certain annual cost, and later
upgrade if they add more frameworks or users. There is no public price list, but anecdotal reports
suggest it’s more affordable than enterprise GRC systems, though not as cheap as one-domain tools. It
likely falls in the few thousand pounds per year range for a small company using it for one standard,
going up with additional modules or larger user counts.
Market presence: ISMS.online has a strong presence in the UK among tech SMEs, consultancies, and
any organizations pursuing ISO certifications. They also partner with many security consultants and
MSPs who use the platform for their clients (the company has a partner directory for advisors who can
assist on the platform)
. While exact user numbers aren’t published, ISMS.online has been
around for several years and claims global users. It’s not unusual for companies that want to get ISO
27001 certified quickly to adopt ISMS.online rather than starting from scratch – the selling point is
accelerating the process with ready-made tools and keeping the ISMS maintained easily afterward. It
may not have the buzz of the VC-funded startups, but it occupies a solid niche for compliance-focused
software in the UK.
Strengths: ISMS.online is praised for being very user-friendly for non-experts and for its rich library
of templates. Essentially it provides a “fill-in-the-blanks” ISMS where an SME can log risks, map controls
to  requirements,  manage  improvement  actions,  and  generate  audit-ready  reports.  It’s  less  about
technical integration and automation (compared to Drata/Vanta which auto-check settings); it’s more
about  documentation  management,  workflow,  and  guidance.  This  makes  it  ideal  for  meeting
governance requirements and passing audits. It also now markets support for NIS2 controls
,
indicating it’s keeping up with new compliance needs.
OneTrust (US/UK) – Broad Compliance Platform (Privacy-Focused)
OneTrust is a big name in compliance software, historically known for privacy and data protection
compliance (cookie consents, GDPR management, etc.), but it also offers modules for security, GRC, and
ethics. OneTrust is headquartered in the US but has a large London presence and many UK customers.
In  the  context  of  cybersecurity  GRC  for  SMEs,  OneTrust’s  relevant  offering  is  its  “Tech  Risk  &
Compliance” module
 – this includes capabilities like policy management, risk registers, control
libraries, assessment automation, and vendor risk management. A company can use OneTrust to map
their controls to frameworks such as ISO 27001 or NIST CSF and track compliance status. However,
OneTrust’s platform is very comprehensive and can be complex, as it’s aimed at larger enterprises
typically.  In  fact,  OneTrust  excels  in  areas  like  privacy  compliance  (e.g.  managing  subject  access
requests  or  cookie  tracking)  and  may  not  have  out-of-the-box  depth  for  some  cybersecurity
frameworks. A 2025 industry review noted that “OneTrust is highly effective in privacy compliance but lacks
the depth required for generic third-party security management and compliance tracking under NIS-2”
. In
other words, OneTrust can be part of a security compliance program, but it’s not specialized for things
like Cyber Essentials and might require more customization for those needs.
Pricing model: OneTrust is modular – clients can license the pieces they need. It is generally one of the
more  expensive  solutions,  as  it  often  targets  enterprise  budgets.  Pricing  is  typically  by  annual
subscription, with cost depending on number of modules, size of data (for privacy modules), and
number of users or records. For an SME, OneTrust might be overkill unless they have substantial privacy
management needs or already use it for GDPR and want to extend it to security GRC. There have been
efforts by OneTrust to offer streamlined packages for smaller businesses (and they do have many mid-
market clients too), but it’s safe to say it’s not a low-cost option. There’s no public price; everything is
custom quoted.
Market presence: OneTrust has a huge global presence – over 12,000 organizations use some part of
its trust platform (privacy, GRC, ethics, etc.). In the UK, many companies adopted OneTrust for GDPR
compliance around 2018. As for cybersecurity compliance specifically, OneTrust is often seen in larger
firms that want an integrated risk management solution. SMEs might encounter OneTrust through its
free tools (they offered free compliance assessments, etc., during earlier days) and then possibly grow
into a paid customer. However, given the competition from more focused SME tools, OneTrust is not
commonly the first choice for a UK SME trying to get, say, Cyber Essentials – it’s more likely used by a
mid-size or large enterprise that needs a unified platform for privacy and security compliance
together.
Competitive  notes: In  the  competitive  landscape,  OneTrust  competes  more  with  enterprise  GRC
solutions (RSA Archer, ServiceNow, etc.) and with privacy-focused platforms. Its advantage is a one-stop-
shop for all “trust” related compliance (security, third-party risk, ethics, privacy, ESG). But for a small
business with narrow needs, lighter options typically suffice. 
6clicks (Australia) – Agile GRC with Extensive Framework Library
6clicks is an Australian-born GRC software platform that has expanded into the UK and other markets.
It offers a full suite of compliance and risk management features, and is notable for its extensive built-
in library of standards and controls – everything from ISO 27001 to NIST, HIPAA, PCI, and yes, NIS2
and others are pre-loaded. The platform positions itself as very flexible and quick to deploy (“out-of-the-
box” compliance automation). Users can use 6clicks to do risk assessments, track compliance gaps,
manage audits, and even handle policy attestations and incident tracking. It also has an AI engine
(“Hailey AI”) to assist with compliance mappings and gap analysis. This makes it somewhat similar to
traditional GRC tools but with a modern twist.
For SMEs, 6clicks can be appealing if they need to handle multiple frameworks or if they are serviced by
consultants – 6clicks actively promotes use by MSPs and advisors (somewhat like ISMS.online does). In
terms of European/UK focus, 6clicks supports UK regulations but as one review pointed out, being an
Australian company, its understanding of European legislation might not be as deep or localized in
the product UI compared to EU-based competitors
. Still, it covers the core requirements just fine via
its content.
Pricing model: 6clicks is SaaS with subscription pricing. They often tout a no user limit approach in
some packages (similar to SureCloud’s angle, focusing on value rather than per-seat cost). There is a
free trial and even a free plan with limited features, which can attract small teams to try it out. For full
functionality, pricing is custom – likely based on the number of frameworks in use and whether you are
an end-company or a partner provider. They have a partner-centric pricing for consultants managing
multiple client environments.
Market presence: Globally, 6clicks is a smaller player compared to the likes of OneTrust or Vanta, but it
has been growing and making its way into Gartner mentions for IRM (Integrated Risk Management). In
the UK, its footprint is still emerging. It does have some UK partners and case studies, but it’s not yet a
household name. Given the crowded field, 6clicks often competes on flexibility and cost. A 3rd-party
assessment ranked 6clicks highly for a comprehensive feature set and quick setup, but noted it was less
intuitive and had fewer ready integrations than some top competitors
. This suggests it might
require a bit more training to use effectively.
In summary, 6clicks offers UK SMEs another option in the GRC platform category – especially if they
want a modern tool that they (or their consultant) can tailor extensively. It’s part of the new wave of GRC
tools trying to be easier than legacy solutions, but it faces strong competition from both local and US
players.
Kaseya Compliance Manager GRC (RapidFire Tools) – MSP-oriented Compliance
Automation
An important player especially in the MSP (Managed Service Provider) channel is Compliance Manager
GRC by RapidFire Tools (now part of Kaseya). This product is a bit different in that it’s often used by IT
service providers to manage compliance for their SME clients, but some larger SMEs use it internally
as well. Compliance Manager GRC provides a centralized system to  manage multiple compliance
standards and IT security requirements – it supports a wide array of frameworks such as PCI DSS,
HIPAA, GDPR, CMMC, NIST, and notably the UK Cyber Essentials. In fact, it quickly updated to include
Cyber Essentials v3.2 requirements (as of April 2025), with content to simplify compliance for IT
teams and MSPs
. 
This  tool  combines  automated  network  and  endpoint  scanning  (especially  focused  on  Windows
environments  via  integrated  CIS  benchmark  scans for  hardening  checks)  with  compliance
documentation  workflows.  It  can  automatically  generate  documents  like  policies,  risk  assessment
reports, and evidence of compliance, which is handy for audits
. The  continuous monitoring
feature will regularly assess endpoint configurations against the chosen standard’s requirements
 – for example, checking if devices stay configured in line with Cyber Essentials technical controls.
The system then produces gap analyses and remediation plans. Essentially, Compliance Manager GRC is
like an auditor-in-a-box that maps IT scan data to compliance checklists.
Pricing  model: Kaseya  sells  this  mostly  to  MSPs  via  annual  licenses  (the  MSP  then  might  offer
“compliance as a service” to end clients). The pricing for an MSP might be based on the number of client
organizations or endpoints under management. For an individual SME using it directly, one would
license the software similarly to other IT software – typically a yearly subscription scaled by company
size. The cost isn’t publicly listed, but given its MSP orientation, it is priced to allow MSPs to margin it in
their service bundles (so likely not exorbitant per end-client). Kaseya often bundles it in their broader IT
Complete suite for MSPs.
Market presence: Compliance Manager (originally by RapidFire) has been around for several years and
gained a strong following among MSPs in the US and UK. A lot of SMEs might be benefiting from it
without knowing – if their IT provider uses it in the background to run security compliance reports for
them.  Its  inclusion  of  UK-specific  standards  like  Cyber  Essentials  shows  Kaseya’s  commitment  to
keeping it relevant for UK regulations
. While it may not be directly advertised to SMEs, it’s a
significant competitor in the sense that it enables  hundreds of IT providers to offer a competing
compliance solution (often under their own branding). For an SME that already has an IT support
provider, that provider might say “we’ll take care of your Cyber Essentials using our tool” – that tool very
possibly could be Compliance Manager GRC. So, it indirectly grabs a chunk of the SME market via
intermediaries.
Key points: The strength of Compliance Manager GRC is in automated technical assessments and
documentation generation. It may be less user-friendly for a business user (it’s geared toward IT
professionals), but it ensures nothing is missed in compliance checks. It also consolidates multiple
frameworks, which is good for MSPs who must deal with varied client needs. Its introduction of a
proprietary  standard  “SMB  Security  Standard  (SMB1001)”
 also  shows  they  are  trying  to  set  a
baseline specifically for SMB cybersecurity – indicating thought leadership in this niche.
Enterprise GRC Solutions (RSA Archer, ServiceNow, etc.) – High-End Options (Rarely
Used by SMEs)
No  survey  of  the  competitive  landscape  would  be  complete  without  mentioning  the  traditional
enterprise GRC platforms. These include  RSA Archer (now Archer IRM),  ServiceNow Governance,
Risk & Compliance,  MetricStream,  IBM OpenPages, and similar heavyweights. These systems are
very powerful and configurable, capable of managing compliance across any framework or regulation.
In theory, an SME could use Archer or ServiceNow to manage Cyber Essentials, NIS, or any custom
control set. However, in practice these tools are expensive, complex, and aimed at large enterprises,
making them impractical for SMEs
.
For instance, ServiceNow GRC is typically an add-on for big companies already using ServiceNow IT
systems – it requires significant implementation effort (often with third-party consultants) and doesn’t
come  with  out-of-the-box  UK  compliance  content.  Archer  likewise  is  known  for  its  cumbersome
interface and heavy customization needs
. Reviews in the context of NIS2 compliance noted
issues such as outdated UI, lack of pre-built templates, reliance on external consultants, and high cost
. These factors put them out of reach for most SMEs that need quick, cost-effective solutions.
Pricing  model: Enterprise  GRC  platforms  usually  involve  high  annual  licensing  costs  (often  six
figures in GBP) plus significant one-time setup costs. They may charge by number of modules and user
seats. This is magnitudes above what typical SME budgets allow for compliance tooling. Thus, unless an
SME is unusually large or in a very heavily regulated space (and perhaps already has these tools for
other reasons), they won’t be using Archer/MetricStream/ServiceNow for Cyber Essentials – it’d be like
swatting a fly with a cannon.
Market  presence: These  platforms  dominate  in  large  corporations,  financial  institutions,  and
governments. They hold a lot of the market share in GRC overall revenue. But in the SME sector in the
UK, their presence is  minimal to none. Instead, SMEs opt for the lighter platforms and services
described earlier. The only scenario an SME might indirectly interface with these is if a parent company
or group uses them (in which case the SME might have to input some compliance data into a larger
Archer system, for example). Or if they hire a consultancy that uses a licensed instance to manage
multiple clients. But those are edge cases.
Summary of limitations: In short, while “you can do anything with Archer/ServiceNow”, the effort
and cost make it a non-starter for SME needs. This is precisely why the newer wave of SME-focused
compliance solutions (like CyberSmart, Drata, etc.) has thrived – they filled the gap that these enterprise
tools left in the small-business market.
Having reviewed the major competitors, we can see the landscape spans from specialized UK-focused
solutions to global SaaS platforms and service-driven offerings. The table below summarizes key details

SureCloud
(UK)
Integrated GRC platform
with both Enterprise and
new “Foundations” edition
for smaller teams. Provides
modules for compliance,
risk, vendor management,
etc. Out-of-the-box support
for key standards (ISO
27001, SOC 2, GDPR, NIS2,
DORA, etc.)
. Emphasizes
no-code configurability and
eliminating spreadsheets
through automation (claims
75% reduction in manual
effort)
. Suitable for
organizations looking to
scale their GRC program.
Annual
subscription. The
SME Foundations
package is a fixed
annual fee (approx.
five figures), e.g.
around £15K/year
for a baseline
package (unlimited
users) as hinted by
marketing. No per-
user charges
.
Custom quotes for
expanded needs.
Established vendor
(since 2004) with
strong UK client base
(enterprise and mid-
market). Now targeting
SMEs; used by notable
UK companies (e.g.
parts of Specsavers,
AutoTrader) for
compliance
. Offers

(with guided
implementation) and
managing ongoing

but pricing is
bespoke (no public
tiers)
. Cost
depends on number
of frameworks and
users. Generally
affordable for small
organizations
compared to big
GRC suites, but
requires a quotation
– e.g. a single-
framework package
for a small business
might be in low ****
thousands/year.
Hundreds of SMEs and
tech firms in the UK
use it, especially for 
ISO 27001. It’s also
popular among
consultants who
implement ISMS for
clients (IO offers
partner programs)
.

use and fast
deployment. Not as
visible as venture-
backed rivals, but a
steady player with a
solid reputation in
compliance circles.

Notable Info
OneTrust (US/
UK)
Comprehensive trust
platform spanning privacy,
security, data governance,
and more. The Tech Risk &
Compliance module covers
infosec GRC: policy
management, control
assessments, risk registers,
compliance automation to
an extent
. OneTrust
excels in privacy (UK GDPR,
cookie compliance) and
integrates that with security
incident and vendor risk
management. However, its
breadth can make it
complex; it’s geared toward
larger orgs, and some
specific cybersecurity
frameworks may need
custom configuration (e.g.
not a turnkey Cyber
Essentials solution out-of-
box)
.
Modular licensing –
enterprise pricing.
Clients might
purchase a bundle of
modules. Prices can
run tens of
thousands £/year
for a full suite. They
do offer scaled-down
packages, but for
most SMEs this is a
significant
investment. Often
justified if the
company has serious
privacy compliance
obligations (and
then adds security
module on top).
Global leader with
12k+ customers (many
in Fortune 500). In UK,
widely used for GDPR
and vendor
compliance. Less
common for SME cyber
compliance specifically,
but some mid-sized UK
firms leverage
OneTrust for
integrated risk
management. Has a
strong brand and
resources (2700+
employees). Not
typically the first
choice for basic CE
needs, but a powerful
option for those
needing a unified
privacy-security-ethics
solution.
6clicks
(Australia)
Modern GRC platform with
a wide library of standards
and rapid deployment
focus. Includes AI features to
streamline compliance
mapping. Supports UK
frameworks (NIS2, ISO,
etc.) and international ones
by default. Offers risk
management, audits,
incident tracking in one
platform. UI is web-based
and geared for consultants
and internal teams alike.
Some limitations in user
experience and fewer native
integrations, but very
comprehensive feature set
for the price
.
SaaS subscription.
Offers flexible
options (including a
free tier and partner
licensing). Likely
priced by the
number of accounts
and modules. Aimed
to be cost-effective –
e.g. could be a mid-£
thousands/year for
an SME deployment,
but exact pricing
varies.
Emerging player –
used by a growing
number of consulting
firms and SMEs
globally. Still building
UK presence; not as
well-known as others
yet. Those who use it
appreciate the all-in-
one approach. Seen as
a challenger to older
GRC tools, with
successful
deployments in
finance, government,
etc., in APAC and
expanding in Europe.

Kaseya
Compliance
Manager GRC
(RapidFire
Tools)
Compliance automation
software often leveraged by
MSPs. Covers UK Cyber
Essentials (latest version)
and other standards, with
built-in scanning of IT
systems to check compliance
. Auto-generates policies,
reports, and evidence
artifacts, and tracks
remediation tasks. Designed
to allow even non-security-
experts (like IT technicians)
to deliver compliance
assessments. Provides
continuous compliance
monitoring especially for
Windows environments
. Ideal for multi-tenant
use (managing several
businesses’ compliance in
one console).
Annual license
(usually MSP-
oriented). MSPs pay
per client or per
asset; they in turn
offer it as a service
to SMEs (often
bundled, e.g. a
monthly fee for
“compliance
service”). Direct use
by SMEs is possible
but less common;
would be a software
subscription likely in
the low thousands
£/yr if sized for one
organization.
Widely deployed via
MSPs in the UK/US.
Many SMEs indirectly
use it through their IT
providers. Strong in the
niche of IT audit
automation. Backed by
Kaseya (large MSP
software company). Its
inclusion of Cyber
Essentials content and
SMB-specific standards
shows commitment to
the SME market
.
Not as visible in direct
marketing to end-
users, but a significant
player through
channel.
Enterprise
GRC Suites
(e.g. RSA
Archer,
ServiceNow,
MetricStream)
High-end GRC/IRM systems
with exhaustive capabilities
to manage risk and
compliance at scale. Can be
configured for any standard
or regulation (NIS, ISO,
internal policies, etc.) and
integrated deeply into
business processes. Offer
advanced analytics,
workflows, and enterprise
system integrations.
However, not productized
for specific SME needs –
require heavy customization
and expertise. Reviews note
they are cumbersome and
expensive, with outdated
interfaces in some cases
.
Enterprise pricing
(very high). Typically
involve large setup
fees and ongoing
costs per module/
user. Often on-prem
or private cloud
deployments for
security. Not feasible
for SME budgets –
usually only justified
in organizations with
dedicated risk
departments.
Dominant in large
enterprise segment
(Fortune 500,
governments). Virtually
0% market share in
SMEs due to cost/
complexity. In context
of UK SME compliance,
these are mentioned
only as theoretical
options – in practice
SMEs opt for more
accessible solutions.
Even mid-tier firms find
these overly complex
for needs like Cyber
Essentials.

Conclusion
The UK SME cybersecurity compliance market is quite dynamic. On one end,  homegrown solutions
like CyberSmart have leveraged local knowledge (e.g. of Cyber Essentials requirements) to capture a
large chunk of small businesses with affordable, easy tools. On the other end, global SaaS platforms
(Drata, Vanta) are bringing Silicon Valley-style automation to UK regulations – a sign of the UK market’s
maturity that even US vendors are integrating schemes like CE and NIS2 into their products. 
For SMEs, the choices often boil down to cost vs. breadth vs. support: Smaller companies with limited
budgets may start with an inexpensive focused tool (or via an MSP service), while those with slightly
more resources or complex needs might invest in a more comprehensive platform or a hybrid service
like DataGuard to cover multiple obligations at once. Pricing models vary from per-device monthly fees
in the tens of pounds to enterprise subscriptions in the tens of thousands, so SMEs must evaluate what
fits their risk appetite and compliance scope.
It’s also worth noting the legislative trend: as government and regulatory requirements tighten (e.g.
potential NIS2-derived laws, supply chain security mandates, etc.), more SMEs will be  obliged to
formally comply with cybersecurity standards. This will likely expand the market for these compliance
solutions further. We can expect competition to increase, possibly driving prices down or spurring
innovation (like more AI assistance in compliance, more integration with insurance as CyberSmart and
others have done, etc.).
In summary, UK SMEs have an increasing array of options to help meet cyber GRC obligations. Whether
it’s a DIY software platform or a managed compliance service, the competitive landscape outlined
above provides solutions for all sizes and budgets. The optimal choice depends on each SME’s specific
regulatory requirements, in-house expertise, and financial constraints. But with providers focusing on
everything from basic certification to continuous enterprise-grade risk management, even the smallest
business can find a path to stay on the right side of UK cybersecurity law and best practice.
