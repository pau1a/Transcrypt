## 2025-11-06 – Decision: MVP scope lock (Transcrypt Core)

- **Problem:** Vision drift between “lightweight assistant” and “full automation platform”.
- **Decision:** v1 is **Transcrypt Core** (lightweight assistant). Platform features are post-MVP.
- **Consequences:** Section 5 constrained to assistive AI; provenance ledger and auditor marketplace deferred to v2.0; Roadmap section added.
