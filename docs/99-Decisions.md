## 2025-11-06 – Decision: MVP scope lock (Transcrypt Core)

- **Problem:** Vision drift between “lightweight assistant” and “full automation platform”.
- **Decision:** v1 is **Transcrypt Core** (lightweight assistant). Platform features are post-MVP.
- **Consequences:** Section 5 constrained to assistive AI; provenance ledger and auditor marketplace deferred to v2.0; Roadmap section added.

## 2025-11-07 – Decision: Closed-Source Policy and Transparency Alignment

- **Problem:** PRD implied both full transparency (open auditing) and a closed-source codebase.  
- **Decision:** Transcrypt remains **closed-source**, but implements **verifiable transparency** through cryptographically signed, user-verifiable outputs.  
- **Consequences:**  
  - §5.5 rewritten to define this principle.  
  - §5.4 cross-references it.  
  - Vision updated to describe transparency via verifiable outputs, not open code.  
  - Future roadmap (v2.0+) includes external notarisation ledger.
