# **1. Introduction**

This Information Architecture defines the structural model of Transcrypt across the Marketing runtime and the Essentials application. It establishes how the system’s surfaces are organised, how users move between them, and how meaning, hierarchy, and navigability are maintained. The IA sits beneath the behavioural rules in the PDS and the architectural constraints in the SAIS, ensuring every page, path, and transition reflects the product intent described in the PRD. This document provides the skeletal framework that governs structure, discoverability, and user flow, forming the basis for coherent design, consistent routing, and predictable interaction across the entire platform.

# **2. Full Sitemap**

The sitemap defines every surface the user can reach across both the Marketing runtime and the Essentials application. It acts as the authoritative inventory of pages and ensures all navigation, routing, and user journeys have a stable structural foundation.

## **2.1 System Surfaces Overview**

## **2.2 Marketing Runtime Surfaces**

## **2.3 Essentials Runtime Surfaces**

## **2.4 Cross-Runtime Junctions**

## **2.5 Hidden or Technical Surfaces (non-navigable)**

# **3. Navigation Model**

This section establishes how users move between surfaces: global navigation, secondary navigation, inline navigation, and conditional navigation states. It ensures movement through the product is predictable, reversible, and free of ambiguity.

## **3.1 Primary Navigation**

## **3.2 Secondary Navigation**

## **3.3 Workflow Navigation**

## **3.4 Suppressed Navigation States**

## **3.5 Mobile Navigation Behaviour**

## **3.6 Navigation Fail-Safes**

# **4. Page Hierarchy**

The hierarchy assigns relative importance to pages and sections, organising them into parent–child relationships. It prevents flat sprawl, supports clear user expectations, and aligns structural depth with narrative weight defined in the PRD.

## **4.1 Structural Tiers**

## **4.2 Sectional Parents**

## **4.3 Page-Level Weighting**

## **4.4 Hierarchical Exceptions**

## **4.5 Edge-Case Elevation Rules**

# **5. SEO Keyword Mapping**

This defines the core information targets for organic search, mapping primary and secondary keywords to specific surfaces. It ensures each page serves a distinct search intent and avoids cannibalisation across the content ecosystem.

## **5.1 Pillar Keyword Targets**

## **5.2 Page-Level Intent Targets**

## **5.3 Semantic Neighbourhoods**

## **5.4 Cannibalisation Boundaries**

## **5.5 Long-Tail Capture Plan**

## **5.6 Deprioritised Keywords**

# **6. Content Types**

This identifies the distinct classes of content the system supports (e.g., articles, guides, evaluation surfaces, legal surfaces). It provides a consistent structural pattern for each type, ensuring predictability and maintainability.

## **6.1 Marketing Types**

## **6.2 Application Types**

## **6.3 Evidence & Report Types**

## **6.4 Structural Requirements Per Type**

# **7. Taxonomy**

The taxonomy defines the classification system used across content, including tags, categories, and thematic groupings. It ensures consistent organisation, improves discoverability, and supports internal search behaviours.

## **7.1 Core Categories**

## **7.2 Extended Categories**

## **7.3 Tag Architecture**

## **7.4 Synonym Rules**

## **7.5 Taxonomy Governance Lifecycle**

## **7.6 Deprecated or Merged Taxonomies**

# **8. URL Structure**

This section details canonical URL formats, parameter rules, slug patterns, and structural URL boundaries. It ensures stability, readability, and long-term compatibility as the site evolves.

## **8.1 Canonical Paths**

## **8.2 Slug Construction**

## **8.3 Parameter Rules**

## **8.4 Pagination Rules**

## **8.5 Redirect Behaviour**

## **8.6 Legacy URL Handling**

## **8.7 Reserved Paths**

# **9. Cross-Linking Strategy**

This establishes when and how surfaces should link to each other to reinforce navigation, improve SEO, and reduce isolating “dead-end” pages. It ensures crosslinks are purposeful, not decorative, and always contextually appropriate.

## **9.1 Mandatory Internal Links**

## **9.2 Contextual Relevance Links**

## **9.3 SEO-Driven Link Clusters**

## **9.4 Cross-Link Suppression Rules**

# **10. Breadcrumb Rules**

Breadcrumbs provide users with a clear orientation within the site’s hierarchy. This section defines when breadcrumbs appear, how they are structured, and how they reflect the underlying page hierarchy.

## **10.1 Eligibility Criteria**

## **10.2 Hierarchy Mapping Rules**

## **10.3 Breadcrumb Composition**

## **10.4 Responsive/Collapsed Breadcrumbs**

## **10.5 Suppressed Breadcrumb Cases**

# **11. Depth/Flatness Constraints**

This governs how deep the IA is allowed to go before it becomes unwieldy and how flat it may become before meaning collapses. It prevents drift into unnecessary nested structures while preserving clarity and navigability.

## **11.1 Maximum Depth Thresholds**

## **11.2 Minimum Depth Thresholds**

## **11.3 Section-Specific Depth Limits**

# **12. Transition Matrix for User Journeys**

This defines every permitted journey between surfaces, including required preconditions and valid exit paths. It ensures all state transitions are deliberate, predictable, and traceable across Marketing, Essentials, Billing, and Reporting.

## **12.1 Valid Transitions**

## **12.2 Forbidden Transitions**

## **12.3 Conditioned Transitions**

## **12.4 Terminal States**
