# **1. Introduction**

Intro

# **2. Full Sitemap**

The sitemap defines every surface the user can reach across both the Marketing runtime and the Essentials application. It acts as the authoritative inventory of pages and ensures all navigation, routing, and user journeys have a stable structural foundation.

# **3. Navigation Model**

This section establishes how users move between surfaces: global navigation, secondary navigation, inline navigation, and conditional navigation states. It ensures movement through the product is predictable, reversible, and free of ambiguity.

# **4. Page Hierarchy**

The hierarchy assigns relative importance to pages and sections, organising them into parent–child relationships. It prevents flat sprawl, supports clear user expectations, and aligns structural depth with narrative weight defined in the PRD.

# **5. SEO Keyword Mapping**

This defines the core information targets for organic search, mapping primary and secondary keywords to specific surfaces. It ensures each page serves a distinct search intent and avoids cannibalisation across the content ecosystem.

# **6. Content Types**

This identifies the distinct classes of content the system supports (e.g., articles, guides, evaluation surfaces, legal surfaces). It provides a consistent structural pattern for each type, ensuring predictability and maintainability.

# **7. Taxonomy**

The taxonomy defines the classification system used across content, including tags, categories, and thematic groupings. It ensures consistent organisation, improves discoverability, and supports internal search behaviours.

# **8. URL Structure**

This section details canonical URL formats, parameter rules, slug patterns, and structural URL boundaries. It ensures stability, readability, and long-term compatibility as the site evolves.

# **9. Cross-Linking Strategy**

This establishes when and how surfaces should link to each other to reinforce navigation, improve SEO, and reduce isolating “dead-end” pages. It ensures crosslinks are purposeful, not decorative, and always contextually appropriate.

# **10. Breadcrumb Rules**

Breadcrumbs provide users with a clear orientation within the site’s hierarchy. This section defines when breadcrumbs appear, how they are structured, and how they reflect the underlying page hierarchy.

# **11. Depth/Flatness Constraints**

This governs how deep the IA is allowed to go before it becomes unwieldy and how flat it may become before meaning collapses. It prevents drift into unnecessary nested structures while preserving clarity and navigability.

# **12. Transition Matrix for User Journeys**

This defines every permitted journey between surfaces, including required preconditions and valid exit paths. It ensures all state transitions are deliberate, predictable, and traceable across Marketing, Essentials, Billing, and Reporting.
