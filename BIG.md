# Brand Identity Guide

The Brand Identity Guide defines the visual and verbal system that represents Transcrypt everywhere it appears. It establishes the rules that make the brand coherent across product, marketing, documentation, demos, presentations, and future customer-facing surfaces.

Where the PRD defines purpose, the SAIS defines architecture, and the PDS defines behaviour, this guide defines expression — the consistent external face of a platform built on determinism, trust, and clarity.

This is not a creative exploration or a loose set of suggestions. It is an operational standard. Every logo file, colour token, typographic choice, spacing rule, illustration, and written sentence must follow the constraints in this guide. Any deviation introduces risk: inconsistency, dilution, misinterpretation, or loss of trust.

Transcrypt’s identity is built the same way its product is built — simple, disciplined, structured, and intolerant of ambiguity. The aim is not flashiness or novelty. The aim is precision, legibility, and a quiet confidence that reflects a platform designed to be safe, predictable, and uncompromising in how it handles customer data and compliance.

The rules here bind designers, writers, engineers, partners, and anyone creating assets on behalf of the company. The result is a single brand that looks, sounds, and behaves like one product, one philosophy, and one promise — wherever it appears.

# 1. Purpose and Positioning

Transcrypt exists to make cybersecurity compliance effortless, reliable, and unambiguous for small and mid-sized organisations. Its purpose is not to entertain, embellish, or posture — but to remove uncertainty, reduce cognitive load, and replace scattered processes with a single, trusted system. This guide defines how that purpose is expressed visually and verbally everywhere the brand appears.

The brand is not decorative. It is an operational tool. The same discipline that governs Transcrypt’s architecture, behaviour, and product decisions governs its identity. Every colour, word, typeface, spacing rule, and asset must serve clarity, trust, and precision. Nothing should distract from the product’s promise: predictable outcomes, verifiable progress, and a calm, structured experience in a domain normally defined by complexity and anxiety.

This section establishes the brand’s strategic position and the narrative foundation that all communication must follow. It prevents drift. It ensures that internal teams, partners, and external contributors reinforce a single, coherent story rather than inventing their own. What follows defines the purpose statement, positioning statement, core story, and messaging pillars — the story engine that drives every line of copy, every page layout, and every marketing asset.

### Purpose Statement

Transcrypt exists to give organisations a simple, trusted path to cybersecurity compliance — replacing confusion and manual effort with clarity, structure, and measurable progress.

### Positioning Statement

For UK SMEs who need to achieve and maintain cybersecurity certifications without specialist staff or bloated enterprise tooling, Transcrypt is the compliance platform that offers a guided, auditable, and stress-free experience. Unlike generic SaaS tools or consultancy-heavy approaches, Transcrypt is built on deterministic architecture, sealed tenancy, and transparent evidence handling, delivering confidence without complexity.

### Core Story

Most small organisations know they need to meet cybersecurity standards, but the process feels like a maze. Requirements are scattered. Evidence is inconsistent. People don’t know what “good” looks like, and the stakes of getting it wrong are high. Transcrypt brings order to this chaos. It guides users step-by-step, explains what matters and why, structures everything that needs to be collected, and turns messy progress into clear, demonstrable readiness. It removes guesswork. It removes fear. It shows organisations that compliance doesn’t have to be complicated — it just has to be structured. With Transcrypt, the path is always knowable, repeatable, and auditable.

### Key Messaging Pillars

These principles anchor every outward-facing message. They do not change.
They form the spine of the brand.

1. **Clarity over complexity**
   The product explains what needs to be done, why it matters, and how to do it — with no jargon, ambiguity, or hidden steps.

2. **Trust through structure**
   Deterministic workflows, sealed tenancy, verifiable evidence, and a predictable user experience make the platform dependable.

3. **Guided, not overwhelming**
   Transcrypt turns the compliance journey into a sequence of understandable tasks, each grounded in clear definitions and practical guidance.

4. **Confidence, not guesswork**
   Every action, artefact, and result is traceable. Users know where they stand, what’s left, and whether they’re ready.

5. **Built for real organisations**
   Designed for the workloads, constraints, and realities of SMEs — not as a stripped-down enterprise tool, but as a system with their world in mind.

Together, these elements define how the brand speaks, behaves, and appears. They set the tone for the rest of this guide and ensure Transcrypt’s identity is as precise, consistent, and dependable as the product itself.

# 6. Iconography and Illustration Style

Transcrypt’s icon system is built on a curated, forked subset of Feather Icons (MIT-licensed). The Feather set provides the geometric base: a 24×24 grid, minimal outlines, and neutral metaphors. All icons used in Transcrypt must conform to the rules in this section, regardless of their origin. Raw Feather assets are never used directly without being brought into the Transcrypt icon library and governed by §6.5.

## 6.1 Icon Style Principles

Icons in Transcrypt are simple, neutral line icons based on a 24×24 grid. The visual model is derived from Feather Icons: clean outlines, no fills by default, and no expressive or playful metaphors. Icons exist to support comprehension, not to add character or decoration.

All icons must:
- Use a 24×24 canvas
- Follow a single, consistent stroke weight
- Avoid texture, gradients, shadows, and depth
- Use widely recognised metaphors only
- Remain visually quiet and subordinate to typography and layout

## 6.5 Icon Creation Governance

Icons are one of the most easily corrupted parts of a brand system. Without strict governance, teams introduce inconsistent stroke weights, proportions, and visual metaphors. This section defines when new icons may be added, how they must be constructed, and how the Feather-based library is curated over time.

### 6.5.1 Feather as the Base Set

Transcrypt uses a curated subset of Feather Icons as its geometric and stylistic base. Only icons that align with Transcrypt’s tone and metaphors are admitted into the library. Raw Feather assets must be:

- Reviewed for metaphor clarity
- Adjusted where necessary to match Transcrypt stroke, corner, and alignment rules
- Renamed to follow the icon naming scheme in §6.5.3

No other third-party icon libraries are permitted.

### 6.5.2 When New Icons May Be Created

New icons (whether adapted from Feather or drawn from scratch) may only be introduced when:

- A concept cannot be expressed using an existing Transcrypt icon
- The concept is essential to product clarity
- The metaphor is widely understood and not culturally ambiguous
- The icon can be expressed within the existing 24×24 geometric model

New icons must not be created for:
- Decorative or campaign-specific purposes
- Emotional expression or brand “personality”
- Concepts that can be expressed with labels alone

### 6.5.3 Naming and Versioning Rules

All icons are stored in the Transcrypt icon library and named using:

`icon-[concept]-[variant]-vX.Y.svg`

Examples:
- `icon-shield-outline-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-upload-default-v1.1.svg`

Rules:
- Concept names are short, functional nouns
- Variants are `outline`, `solid`, or `default` (solid only if explicitly allowed later)
- Versioning follows the semantic scheme in §10.4

Feather’s original filenames are not used in product; they are internal to upstream source only.

### 6.5.4 Approval Workflow

Every icon added or modified must pass:

1. **Purpose review** – do we actually need an icon here?
2. **Geometry review** – 24×24 grid, stroke weight, corner radius, optical balance
3. **Accessibility review** – legible at small sizes, clear on light and dark backgrounds
4. **System review** – consistent with existing icon set and layout rules
5. **Versioning and archiving** – old versions retained; changes logged per §10.4

### 6.5.5 Prohibited Icon Constructs

The following are not allowed in the Transcrypt icon system, Feather or otherwise:

- Multi-colour icons
- Gradients, shadows, depth
- Playful or metaphor-heavy icons (e.g., mascots, faces, cartoons)
- Icons that imply celebration or emotion (confetti, fireworks, expressive faces)
- Icons with excessive internal detail that collapse at small sizes

If a Feather icon violates these rules, it must not be imported into the Transcrypt library.

## 8.7 Wireframes and Structural Examples

Wireframes visualise Transcrypt’s structural logic without the distraction of colour, typography, or imagery. They are functional blueprints — tools for communicating layout rhythm, information hierarchy, spacing, and behavioural patterns before visual styling is applied.
They exist to ensure that every surface designed under the Transcrypt brand inherits the same clarity, calmness, and predictable flow defined in the PDS and reinforced by this guide.

Wireframes are **not** creative artefacts.
They are structural evidence of adherence to the system.

### **8.7.1 Purpose of Wireframes**

Wireframes serve as the intermediate layer between layout rules (Section 8.1–8.4) and real-world marketing or application surfaces (Section 9). Their purpose is to:

* Validate the spatial grid in real contexts
* Test information hierarchy before visual styling
* Expose layout issues early (density, imbalance, cognitive weight)
* Demonstrate correct use of spacing, rhythm, and block composition
* Provide partners and contractors with an unambiguous structural template

Every significant layout — page templates, dashboards, forms, modals, onboarding flows — must be wireframed before typography, colour, or imagery is applied.

### **8.7.2 Core Layout Wireframes**

Core layout wireframes illustrate the structural backbone of the brand. Every layout must obey:

* **Consistent grid usage:** 12-column default, with documented breakpoints
* **Predictable spacing:** following the fixed or modular scale defined in Section 8.3
* **Clean hierarchy:** one dominant H1 block, clear secondary blocks, and grouped tertiary elements
* **No visual noise:** whitespace is an active structural component, not an optional one

Core wireframes must be produced for:

* **Homepage framework** (hero zone, clarity block, CTA structure)
* **Content pages** (blog/article layouts)
* **Feature or landing pages**
* **Documentation-style layouts**
* **Dashboard or app pages** where relevant

Each wireframe shows *structure only* — boxes, labels, spacing, and flow.

### **8.7.3 Form and Flow Wireframes**

Forms and workflows have strict structural requirements due to Transcrypt’s purpose: reduce cognitive load and eliminate ambiguity.

Wireframes must demonstrate:

* **Single-column form layouts** for readability and clarity
* **Clear field grouping** using spacing, not borders
* **Minimal branching** in any given interaction
* **Predictable CTA placement:** right-aligned primary, left or centre secondary
* **Inline validation areas** that preserve rhythm and do not shift the layout erratically

Flow wireframes must include:

* **Step-by-step task flows**
* **Verification or review steps**
* **Progress indicators**
* **Error and fallback states**

These wireframes define behaviour and guidance long before visuals appear.

### **8.7.4 Do and Don’t Wireframe Patterns**

Wireframes must make acceptable and unacceptable patterns explicit.

**Acceptable:**

* Generous spacing
* Calm rhythm with minimal visual density
* One visual focus per screen
* Predictable alignment of elements
* Clear, unambiguous reading paths

**Forbidden:**

* Crowded layouts
* Overuse of columns (no multi-column forms)
* Excessive grouping lines or boxed sections
* Surprise elements (pop-ins, floating blocks, disconnected CTAs)
* Visually aggressive structures (tight density, inconsistent block widths)

Wireframes act as the inspection mechanism: if a layout doesn't wireframe cleanly, it will not behave cleanly once styled.

---

## **8.8 State and Mode Patterns**

State and mode patterns define how Transcrypt behaves in every non-ideal or transitional situation. These states carry significant brand weight: they influence user trust more than static surfaces. They must be calm, unambiguous, structured, and free of theatrics.
Every loading sequence, error message, success confirmation, or empty pattern must follow the same predictable rules to preserve the brand’s promise of clarity and confidence.

No state may introduce surprise, motion spikes, playful language, or unnecessary visual noise.

### **8.8.1 Loading States**

Loading patterns must:

* Use **minimal, low-motion indicators**
* Preserve layout structure; no content “jumping”
* Avoid skeleton screens unless the structural layout requires them
* Use neutral language: *“Loading…”*, *“Preparing view…”*
* Never use humour, filler text, or animations with character or personality

Loading indicators must not distract or imply instability.
No pulsing colour, no playful metaphors, no progress bars unless time is genuinely meaningful.

### **8.8.2 Empty States**

Empty states exist to reduce uncertainty. They must:

* Clearly state why the space is empty
* Provide one primary next action (e.g., “Add evidence”)
* Use short, directive copy
* Include a small visual indicator *only if it reinforces clarity*

Empty states must not use:

* Metaphors
* Illustrations implying emotion
* Humorous or “light” tone
* Decorative visuals

The intention is calm instruction, not engagement or entertainment.

### **8.8.3 Validation and Error States**

Error states must be clinical, factual, and free from dramatics.

Rules:

* Use **precise, actionable language**: *“This field is required.”*, *“Invalid email format.”*
* Avoid blame, personality, humour, or conversational flourishes
* Highlight only the affected element — no full-screen error patterns unless the system is genuinely unavailable
* Never animate errors; no shaking, bouncing, pulsing, or colour flashes

Colour use must follow Section 4.5 (Prohibited Applications):
Errors must meet WCAG; no high-saturation reds or flashing affordances.

### **8.8.4 Success and Confirmation States**

Success feedback must:

* Be minimal and brief
* Use clean, neutral confirmation: *“Saved.”*, *“Completed.”*
* Avoid celebratory icons, emojis, confetti, ticks with flourish, or bright colour flashes
* Maintain layout stability; do not shift the interface unnecessarily

Transcrypt does not do “congratulations,” “you’re all set!”, or any copy implying personality or emotional performance.

### **8.8.5 Pending, Review, and Intermediate States**

These states occur when work is in progress but not yet complete—especially relevant to compliance workflows.

Rules:

* Use precise descriptors: *“Pending review”*, *“Awaiting confirmation”*, *“In progress”*
* No metaphors about “journeys,” “paths,” or “processing magic”
* Maintain stable structure; avoid intermediate animations

If a user must wait for back-end operations, fallback messages must be clear and deterministic.

### **8.8.6 System-Level Error Modes**

For outages, integration failures, or major exceptions:

* Use structured, audit-aligned messaging
* Avoid blaming language or conversational tone
* Provide one clear fallback path
* Include an incident identifier for support

No humour, no brand personality, no flourish.
System errors represent reputational risk and must reinforce calm professionalism.

### **8.8.7 Interaction Modes**

Interaction modes define how users move through tasks:

* Focus states must be visible, WCAG-compliant, and restrained
* Hover states (desktop) must be minimal and avoid colour jumps
* Disabled states must be clearly distinguishable
* Active states must rely on structural cues, not strong colour

Modes must never introduce:

* Glow effects
* Neon accents
* Animated highlights
* Playful feedback

The product must remain calm at all times.

### **8.8.8 Fallback and No-JS States**

If JavaScript is disabled or fails:

* Primary content must remain readable
* Critical actions must degrade gracefully
* Errors must follow the same tone and structural rules

No fallback may present a broken or partially styled identity.

## 11.4 Icon and Illustration Library
### 11.4.1 Delivery Format

All icons are delivered as optimised SVG files through the Transcrypt icon library. Consumers must not pull directly from upstream Feather packages. Only the curated, Transcrypt-governed set may be used in product, marketing, or documentation.

The library includes:
- Core UI icons (navigation, actions, status)
- Compliance and security metaphors (evidence, controls, reports, shields)
- A small set of supporting symbols required by the Essentials App

### 11.4.2 File Organisation

Icons are organised by functional group, not by their original Feather naming:

- `core/` – generic UI actions (add, edit, delete, search, filter)
- `navigation/` – menu, back, forward, external link
- `status/` – info, warning, error, success
- `compliance/` – shield, checklist, evidence, report
- `system/` – settings, user, tenant, integration

Feather remains an upstream source only. The Transcrypt icon library is the single source of truth for all shipped icon assets.

### 11.4.3 Core Icon Set (Initial Release)

The Core Icon Set defines the minimum viable group of icons required for the Transcrypt Essentials App, website, and documentation. These icons are based on curated and geometry-corrected Feather Icons and represent the canonical assets for v1 of the identity system.

Each icon listed below exists in the `/assets/icons/` directory and follows the naming, geometry, and versioning rules defined in §6.5.

#### Navigation & Interface
- `icon-menu-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-arrow-left-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-arrow-right-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-external-link-default-v1.0.svg`

#### Actions
- `icon-add-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-edit-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-delete-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-upload-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-download-default-v1.0.svg`

#### Status & Feedback
- `icon-info-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-warning-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-error-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-success-default-v1.0.svg`

#### Compliance & Security
- `icon-shield-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-checklist-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-file-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-evidence-default-v1.0.svg`
- `icon-report-default-v1.0.svg`

This set forms the baseline. New icons may only be added through the governance workflow defined in §6.5.

Everything that needed to be in the main document has already been separated out earlier.

Drop this directly into your BIG, immediately after Section 12.

---

# **13. Future Work**

This section outlines areas of the brand system that are intentionally deferred. They are not required for the stability, coherence, or correctness of the current identity. Each represents an extension that will become relevant as Transcrypt’s product surface grows, its marketing channels expand, or new operational needs emerge.
These items should be prioritised as the platform matures, new modules or tiers are introduced, or external demands justify additional identity layers.

Future work items must not be implemented ad-hoc. They require the same rigour, review, and versioning discipline defined in §10.4.

---

## **13.1 Data Visualisation Identity**

Transcrypt will eventually present structured progress indicators, audit-readiness scores, task completion ratios, and other compliance-related metrics.
A dedicated data visualisation identity will be required to define:

* Approved chart types
* Semantic colour mappings
* Minimum contrast and accessibility rules
* Motion restrictions
* Prohibited chart forms
* Structural templates for dashboards and reports

This work is deferred until visualisation becomes part of the product surface.

---

## **13.2 Illustration Scaling and Integration**

The current system defines illustration tone and metaphor. Future expansion will define:

* Scaling rules for mobile, cards, and hero surfaces
* Integration rules with photography
* Responsive behaviour
* Acceptable and prohibited styles for multi-illustration sets

This will be activated when illustration becomes a recurring pattern across marketing and product.

---

## **13.3 Sub-Brand and Tier Architecture**

As Transcrypt adds modules, feature tiers, or related products, a formal sub-brand strategy will be required. This includes:

* Naming conventions
* Colour or accent differentiation
* Typography accents
* Logo or lockup variations (if any)
* Rules preventing brand fragmentation

This will be developed when expansion beyond the Essentials App is planned.

---

## **13.4 Physical Space and Environmental Branding**

When Transcrypt first appears in physical environments — conferences, booths, signage, or printed events — additional guidance will be required for:

* Large-format typography
* Distance legibility
* Banner and backdrop layouts
* Physical material constraints
* Lighting and colour fidelity in real-world spaces

This is deferred until Transcrypt participates in live events.

---

## **13.5 Social Behaviour and Channel Identity**

While core templates exist in §9, a deeper behavioural identity for social channels will be needed as the brand’s public presence grows.
Future work will define:

* Posting tone
* Platform-specific constraints (LinkedIn, X, YouTube, etc.)
* Hashtag rules
* Reactive content guidance
* Image–text balance per channel
* Prohibited topics and formats

This becomes essential when daily or campaign-driven posting begins.

---

## **13.6 Design Tokenisation and Brand API**

As engineering and product UI surface expand, Transcrypt will require a design-token system that expresses:

* Semantic colour tokens
* Typography tokens
* Spacing and rhythm tokens
* Motion tokens
* JSON/CSS variable exports
* Versioned token distribution for developers

This is deferred until UI implementation begins at scale.

---

## **13.7 Brand Drift Detection and Automation**

To maintain long-term integrity, automated checks may be added to detect:

* Outdated logo files
* Deprecated colour values
* Incorrect typography usage
* Token drift in UI code
* Off-brand layouts in shared folders
* Missing attribution in imagery

This future capability extends the governance model in §10 and reinforces Transcrypt’s principle of deterministic brand expression.
