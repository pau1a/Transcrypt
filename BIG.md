# Brand Identity Guide

The Brand Identity Guide defines the visual and verbal system that represents Transcrypt everywhere it appears. It establishes the rules that make the brand coherent across product, marketing, documentation, demos, presentations, and future customer-facing surfaces.

Where the PRD defines purpose, the SAIS defines architecture, and the PDS defines behaviour, this guide defines expression — the consistent external face of a platform built on determinism, trust, and clarity.

This is not a creative exploration or a loose set of suggestions. It is an operational standard. Every logo file, colour token, typographic choice, spacing rule, illustration, and written sentence must follow the constraints in this guide. Any deviation introduces risk: inconsistency, dilution, misinterpretation, or loss of trust.

Transcrypt’s identity is built the same way its product is built — simple, disciplined, structured, and intolerant of ambiguity. The aim is not flashiness or novelty. The aim is precision, legibility, and a quiet confidence that reflects a platform designed to be safe, predictable, and uncompromising in how it handles customer data and compliance.

The rules here bind designers, writers, engineers, partners, and anyone creating assets on behalf of the company. The result is a single brand that looks, sounds, and behaves like one product, one philosophy, and one promise — wherever it appears.

# 1. Purpose and Positioning

Transcrypt exists to make cybersecurity compliance effortless, reliable, and unambiguous for small and mid-sized organisations. Its purpose is not to entertain, embellish, or posture — but to remove uncertainty, reduce cognitive load, and replace scattered processes with a single, trusted system. This guide defines how that purpose is expressed visually and verbally everywhere the brand appears.

The brand is not decorative. It is an operational tool. The same discipline that governs Transcrypt’s architecture, behaviour, and product decisions governs its identity. Every colour, word, typeface, spacing rule, and asset must serve clarity, trust, and precision. Nothing should distract from the product’s promise: predictable outcomes, verifiable progress, and a calm, structured experience in a domain normally defined by complexity and anxiety.

This section establishes the brand’s strategic position and the narrative foundation that all communication must follow. It prevents drift. It ensures that internal teams, partners, and external contributors reinforce a single, coherent story rather than inventing their own. What follows defines the purpose statement, positioning statement, core story, and messaging pillars — the story engine that drives every line of copy, every page layout, and every marketing asset.

### Purpose Statement

Transcrypt exists to give organisations a simple, trusted path to cybersecurity compliance — replacing confusion and manual effort with clarity, structure, and measurable progress.

### Positioning Statement

For UK SMEs who need to achieve and maintain cybersecurity certifications without specialist staff or bloated enterprise tooling, Transcrypt is the compliance platform that offers a guided, auditable, and stress-free experience. Unlike generic SaaS tools or consultancy-heavy approaches, Transcrypt is built on deterministic architecture, sealed tenancy, and transparent evidence handling, delivering confidence without complexity.

### Core Story

Most small organisations know they need to meet cybersecurity standards, but the process feels like a maze. Requirements are scattered. Evidence is inconsistent. People don’t know what “good” looks like, and the stakes of getting it wrong are high. Transcrypt brings order to this chaos. It guides users step-by-step, explains what matters and why, structures everything that needs to be collected, and turns messy progress into clear, demonstrable readiness. It removes guesswork. It removes fear. It shows organisations that compliance doesn’t have to be complicated — it just has to be structured. With Transcrypt, the path is always knowable, repeatable, and auditable.

### Key Messaging Pillars

These principles anchor every outward-facing message. They do not change.
They form the spine of the brand.

1. **Clarity over complexity**
   The product explains what needs to be done, why it matters, and how to do it — with no jargon, ambiguity, or hidden steps.

2. **Trust through structure**
   Deterministic workflows, sealed tenancy, verifiable evidence, and a predictable user experience make the platform dependable.

3. **Guided, not overwhelming**
   Transcrypt turns the compliance journey into a sequence of understandable tasks, each grounded in clear definitions and practical guidance.

4. **Confidence, not guesswork**
   Every action, artefact, and result is traceable. Users know where they stand, what’s left, and whether they’re ready.

5. **Built for real organisations**
   Designed for the workloads, constraints, and realities of SMEs — not as a stripped-down enterprise tool, but as a system with their world in mind.

Together, these elements define how the brand speaks, behaves, and appears. They set the tone for the rest of this guide and ensure Transcrypt’s identity is as precise, consistent, and dependable as the product itself.

## 1.1 Role of the Brand Identity Guide

This guide defines how Transcrypt presents itself visually and verbally across every surface. It establishes the rules that maintain coherence between product, marketing, documentation, and any future public-facing channels. Its role is to ensure the brand expresses the same philosophy everywhere: clarity, restraint, structure, and predictable behaviour.

### 1.1.1 Scope of the Guide

This guide defines:

* The visual identity: colour palette, typography, iconography, spacing, grid systems, layout structure.
* The verbal identity: tone of voice, writing rules, naming conventions, language constraints.
* The expression layer across all surfaces: website, product UI, docs, slide decks, assets, and external communication.
* The boundaries that prevent visual or tonal drift.
* The rules that designers, writers, engineers, and partners must follow when creating anything that represents Transcrypt.

It acts as the expression layer of the broader system defined by the PRD, SAIS, and PDS. Where those documents define purpose, architecture, and behaviour, this guide defines identity and presentation.

### 1.1.2 What the Guide Does Not Cover

This guide does not define:

* Product behaviour, user flows, or interaction logic (covered by the PDS).
* System architecture, tenancy model, data flow, or operational invariants (covered by the SAIS).
* Product strategy, feature scope, or the reasoning behind decisions (covered by the PRD).
* Commercial strategy, pricing, or go-to-market plans.
* Regulatory interpretation or compliance obligations.
* Engineering implementation details or code-level patterns.

The Brand Identity Guide controls *how* Transcrypt is expressed.
It does not decide *what* is built or *how* it works under the hood. It sits alongside PRD, SAIS, and PDS as a fourth pillar: expression, not architecture.

---

## 1.2 Relationship to PRD, SAIS, and PDS

The Brand Identity Guide is not an independent creative document. It is the final expression layer in a chain of upstream constraints. It inherits purpose from the PRD, system truth from the SAIS, and behavioural rules from the PDS. Nothing in this guide may contradict or reinterpret those documents. Its role is to translate them into a consistent visual and verbal identity across every surface where Transcrypt appears.

### 1.2.1 Upstream Document Dependency

The Brand Identity Guide depends directly on the three core Transcrypt documents:

#### PRD: Purpose, promise, and positioning

The PRD defines why Transcrypt exists, who it is for, and what outcomes it must guarantee.
The brand inherits these constraints. It may not introduce themes, claims, metaphors, or tones that extend beyond the PRD’s intent.
If the PRD does not promise a capability, the brand may not imply it.

#### SAIS: Architecture, invariants, and system truth

The SAIS defines sealed tenancy, deterministic behaviour, data isolation, evidence integrity, and the operational laws of the platform.
The brand must never conflict with these architectural truths.
If the SAIS defines low motion, strict isolation, or minimalism, the brand must reflect it.
Brand expression cannot violate the platform’s physics.

#### PDS: Behaviour, layout, and interaction rules

The PDS defines how the product behaves in a user’s hands: states, spacing, hierarchy, error models, motion limits, and interaction patterns.
The brand may define style and tone but must never override or contradict behavioural rules already codified in the PDS.
If the PDS prohibits theatrics, celebration, or emotional language, the brand inherits those prohibitions.

Together, these upstream documents form the non-negotiable substrate of the Brand Identity Guide.
This guide expresses the system; it does not invent its own.

### 1.2.2 Downstream Influence on Marketing and Product

Once defined, the Brand Identity Guide governs the expression layer across all downstream surfaces.
Every asset, interface, and communication must follow the rules set here.

This includes:

#### Marketing surfaces

Website, landing pages, blog, social media templates, advertising, presentations, print media, and any public-facing asset.
All must use the approved tone, typography, colour system, spacing rules, and structural patterns.

#### Product and application surfaces

UI, dashboards, forms, states, tables, navigation, diagrams, and in-product communication.
Styling, tone, iconography, layout choices, and visual metaphors must follow the guide exactly.
Behaviour continues to be governed by the PDS; visual and verbal expression is governed by this guide.

#### Documentation and communication

User guides, internal docs, onboarding materials, email notifications, PDF exports, and compliance-facing outputs.
These must adopt the same tone, typography, and visual identity to preserve consistency and trust.

The Brand Identity Guide is therefore the binding contract for expression across Transcrypt.
Upstream documents define intent, architecture, and behaviour.
This guide defines how they look, sound, and present themselves in every real-world context.

---

## 1.3 Intended Audience

The Brand Identity Guide exists to maintain a single, consistent expression of Transcrypt across every surface. Although Transcrypt is developed by one person, the guide must serve all present and future roles involved in creating, publishing, or automating branded assets. Its audience therefore includes internal roles, automated systems, and any future external contributors.

### 1.3.1 Internal Teams

“Internal teams” refers to every function involved in producing Transcrypt assets, even when those functions are carried out by a single individual. This includes:

#### 1. Core roles

Marketing, design, product, engineering, documentation, and operational communication.
Even when performed by one person, these roles require consistent rules to prevent context-switch drift or stylistic inconsistency.

#### 2. Functional personas

Operational personas such as Brian (public-facing marketing voice), Ged (technical collaborator), and Flash (diagram generation) must follow this guide exactly.
They do not have creative freedom; they inherit the brand constraints defined here.

#### 3. Automated systems

Static site generators, PDF export pipelines, template engines, CSS token systems, and any automated layout or content tools must pull their styling and tone from this guide.
Automation must not generate alternative styles or “interpretations”.

#### 4. Future roles

If additional help is added later—contractors, illustrators, editors, or virtual assistants—this guide provides the binding rules for their output.
No internal role, present or future, may deviate from the identity defined in this document.

### 1.3.2 External Partners

External partners include any party outside Transcrypt who produces, modifies, or distributes branded materials. Even if no such partners exist now, this guide defines the rules they must follow if they are engaged in the future.

#### 1. Scope of external work

This includes design contractors, marketing freelancers, print vendors, video editors, illustrators, and event organisers.
Any asset they create must conform to the rules defined here—typography, colour, layout, tone, spacing, and structural patterns.

#### 2. No creative reinterpretation

External partners are not permitted to “reinterpret” the brand, propose alternative directions, or introduce personal stylistic preferences.
The identity is a fixed system, not a collaborative exploration.

#### 3. Escalation requirements

If a rule is unclear or appears to be missing, external partners must seek clarification rather than guess.
Assumptions, approximations, or stylistic improvisations are not permitted.

#### 4. Compliance across mediums

The rules in this guide apply equally to digital, print, environmental, and social surfaces.
No external contributor may relax constraints for convenience, format, or familiarity.

---

## 1.4 Brand Philosophy and Identity Principles

The brand exists to reduce anxiety, not to add noise. Every design, copy, and interaction decision must respect the following principles:

1. **Clarity first**
   If a choice exists between clever wording and clear wording, clear wins. If a visual treatment risks confusion, it is not allowed. Users must always know where they are, what they are looking at, and what happens next.

2. **Calm by default**
   The product operates in stressful contexts: audits, incidents, deadlines. The brand must counter that stress, not amplify it. No loud colour clashes, no aggressive motion, no dramatic language. Calm, measured, and predictable at all times.

3. **Structure as reassurance**
   Grids, spacing, and hierarchy are not aesthetic flourishes; they are signals that the system is ordered, thought through, and safe to trust. Layouts must feel deliberate: consistent margins, predictable typography, and repeatable patterns across screens.

4. **Evidence over claims**
   Wherever possible, show rather than tell. Progress indicators, timelines, and clear status states are preferred over marketing promises. The brand earns trust by exposing structure and evidence, not by insisting on its own credibility.

5. **Neutral, human, and unbranded in tone**
   The voice is human but restrained: no slang, no memes, no “on-trend” phrasing that will date quickly. Transcrypt speaks like a calm specialist who has seen these problems before and can explain them without ego.

6. **Deterministic, not magical**
   Transcrypt is powered by solid architecture and clear workflows, not “black box” magic. Avoid metaphors that suggest guessing, intuition, or AI wizardry. Emphasise repeatability, auditability, and explicit rules.

7. **Single system, many surfaces**
   Marketing site, app UI, docs, emails, and decks are all expressions of one system. Designers and writers may not “reinvent” the brand for each surface. Local variation is allowed only where this guide explicitly permits it.

Any proposed deviation from these principles must be justified in writing and, if accepted, recorded as an explicit update under §10.4 Versioning and Release Management.

---

# 2. Core Brand Identity

Transcrypt’s identity is not an aesthetic choice; it is a structural expression of the system described in the PRD, SAIS, and PDS. Where those documents define purpose, architecture, and behaviour, this section defines the internal character of the brand — the values, tone, and personality constraints that shape every visual and verbal decision. These principles ensure Transcrypt expresses itself with the same clarity, discipline, and determinism that govern the product itself. Nothing here is optional or inspirational. These are the rules that anchor all expression across product, marketing, documentation, and future surfaces.

## 2.1 Brand Values and Personality

Transcrypt’s values and personality are grounded in the realities of security, compliance, and evidential systems. They reflect the calm, structured, and predictable nature of the platform, and they exist to minimise cognitive load, avoid theatrics, and maintain trust. These values flow directly from the architectural and behavioural constraints defined upstream; they are not creative inventions but system-derived requirements.

### 2.1.1 Primary Values

#### 1. Clarity

Every surface must prioritise readability, comprehension, and explicit meaning. The brand avoids ambiguity, jargon drift, decorative noise, and any element that obscures intent. Clarity is not a stylistic preference; it is a fulfilment of the PRD’s mandate to remove uncertainty and reduce cognitive load.

#### 2. Structure

Layouts, spacing, tone, and hierarchy must reflect the ordered, deterministic nature of the platform. Consistency is a security posture. The brand expresses this through predictable grids, stable tone, and unchanging rules.

#### 3. Trust

Trust is earned through visible restraint, reliability, and precision. The brand does not shout, oversell, or dramatise. It communicates as a steady, dependable system — the same way the architecture behaves.

#### 4. Neutrality

Transcrypt’s identity avoids emotional colour, humour, personality spikes, and conversational affect. Neutral language and calm visuals reduce stress and increase comprehension, which directly supports compliance workflows.

#### 5. Calm

Compliance and audits often create pressure. The brand counterbalances this with quiet surfaces, minimal motion, clear language, and stable layouts. Calmness is a functional requirement, not an aesthetic choice.

#### 6. Evidence over assertion

Statements are factual, grounded, and unexaggerated. The brand mirrors the evidence model in the product: claims are supported by structure, not flourish. Hyperbole, vague claims, and hype adjectives are prohibited.

#### 7. Discipline

Brand expression follows strict rules with no improvisation. Discipline ensures predictability and prevents drift as Transcrypt’s footprint expands. Every decision must reflect intentionality and constraint.

### 2.1.2 Emotional Tone

Transcrypt’s tone is the verbal reflection of its architecture: calm, neutral, and deterministic. It avoids the emotional volatility common in consumer brands and the theatrical reassurance often found in security marketing.

#### 1. Calm

Language remains steady and unfussy. Sentences are short, factual, and free from rhetorical performance. No urgency unless legally required.

#### 2. Neutral

No humour, cuteness, cheerfulness, hype, or conversational flair. The tone is informational, not personality-driven.

#### 3. Quietly confident

The brand is authoritative without being forceful. It states facts plainly and avoids both bravado and apology. Confidence comes from clarity, not volume.

#### 4. Factual

Uses concrete nouns and direct verbs. Avoids hyperbolic descriptors. No unnecessary adjectives. No metaphors implying magic, journeys, transformation, or heroics.

#### 5. Helpful, not friendly

The brand assists the user without trying to entertain them. It prioritises user focus and cognitive stability over rapport or warmth.

#### 6. Predictable

All communications sound like they come from the same place. There are no mood shifts, tonal deviations, or stylistic surprises.

#### 7. Non-manipulative

No fear-based framing. No emotional appeals. Compliance is serious; the brand must be stabilising, not pressurising.

---

## 2.2 Tone of Voice

Transcrypt’s tone of voice is the verbal expression of its architecture. It must be as calm, predictable, and structured as the platform itself. Tone is not used to create personality or emotional colour; its purpose is to reduce cognitive load, avoid ambiguity, and reinforce trust. The voice used across all written communication — product UI, website, documentation, marketing assets, support responses, and exported reports — must follow the same rules with no exceptions. Tone is therefore a system boundary, not a stylistic option.

### 2.2.1 Writing Style

Transcrypt’s writing style is grounded in clarity, restraint, and factual precision. It supports compliance work by eliminating unnecessary mental effort and by presenting information in a neutral, direct manner.

#### 1. Clear

Sentences are short, direct, and free of decorative language. Concrete nouns and direct verbs are preferred. Meaning must be explicit at first reading.

#### 2. Calm

The tone does not express excitement, urgency, apology, or emotional colour. No exclamation marks are used. No stylistic devices imply speed, drama, or pressure.

#### 3. Factual

Copy states what is required, what is happening, or what the user must do next. It avoids speculation, persuasion, and unfounded claims.

#### 4. Neutral

There is no humour, playfulness, or conversational friendliness. The writing does not mimic personality. It simply communicates information.

#### 5. Sparse

Adjectives are used only when necessary for meaning. There are no rhetorical flourishes, circular explanations, or narrative introductions. Brevity is a functional requirement.

#### 6. Instructional

Actions use clear imperatives: “Add device”, “Upload evidence”, “Review answers”. Conversational patterns such as “Let’s do this” or “Ready to continue?” are prohibited.

#### 7. Consistent

The same tone is used across all mediums. Marketing pages, blog posts, UI strings, and documentation must read as if written by a single steady system.

#### 8. Non-emotive

Copy must not express sympathy, encouragement, disappointment, enthusiasm, or reassurance. Compliance work requires cognitive stability, not emotional signalling.

#### 9. Deterministic

Language patterns remain stable over time. There are no mood shifts, stylistic experiments, or contextual tone changes. Writing must reflect the deterministic nature of the system.

### 2.2.2 Language Restrictions

Language restrictions prevent drift, inconsistency, and accidental introduction of emotion or hype. Any content that violates these rules is considered off-brand.

#### 1. No emotional or expressive language

Avoid words suggesting excitement, delight, frustration, or friendliness.
Examples of prohibited language: “excited”, “delighted”, “happy to help”, “don’t worry”.

#### 2. No hype or marketing superlatives

Prohibited: “cutting-edge”, “transformative”, “revolutionary”, “industry-leading”, “state-of-the-art”.
If a claim cannot be demonstrated through evidence, it is not permitted.

#### 3. No metaphors or figurative imagery

Avoid metaphors about journeys, magic, unlocking, levelling up, heroics, or guidance companions.
The brand communicates literally, not symbolically.

#### 4. No conversational devices

Prohibited: rhetorical questions, casual phrasing, emojis, slang, idioms, chatty statements, regionalisms, and informal contractions that add friendliness.

#### 5. No artificial intensity

Words suggesting urgency, speed, or alarm are banned unless mandated by regulation.
Avoid: “immediately”, “urgent”, “critical”, “as soon as possible”.

#### 6. No first-person subjectivity

Avoid: “we believe”, “we think”, “in our view”.
The brand is a structured system, not a personal perspective.

#### 7. No apologies unless legally required

Avoid: “Sorry about that”.
Use neutral factual patterns: “This action failed. Try again.”

#### 8. No over-reassurance

Avoid: “You’re on track”, “Almost there”, “You’re all set”.
Compliance surfaces must remain objective and unemotional.

#### 9. No humour

Humour, puns, and playful phrasing are prohibited across all surfaces.

#### 10. No stylistic emphasis

Avoid ALL CAPS for emphasis, elongated punctuation, decorative formatting, or typographic novelty.

#### 11. Precise use of modal language

Avoid weak modality: “might”, “could”, “should”, unless describing regulatory ambiguity.
Prefer direct statements that reduce interpretation.

---

## 2.3 Naming and Linguistic Rules

Transcrypt’s naming system is part of its structural integrity. Every concept, feature, and action must use a single, literal, unambiguous name across the product, documentation, marketing, and all external surfaces. Naming is not a creative layer; it is an extension of the architecture. One concept must map to one term, and that term must remain stable. No synonyms, metaphors, or stylistic variants are permitted. Any name change is treated as a versioned event under §10.4.

### 2.3.1 Product Naming Rules

#### 1. Company name

The company name is always **Transcrypt**.
No camel-case, spacing, punctuation, invented capitalisation, or stylised variants.
The name is not abbreviated and not translated.

#### 2. Product and module names

Product and module names must be literal, descriptive, and concise.
They must not imply capabilities not defined in the PRD or contradict architectural truths in the SAIS.

Permitted pattern examples:

* Transcrypt Essentials
* Transcrypt Essentials Plus (tier descriptor only)

Not permitted: invented words, thematic naming, metaphorical pack names, or emotive language.

#### 3. Feature names

Features must use the clearest possible noun for the concept they represent.
Examples of canonical terms:

* Evidence
* Controls
* Tasks
* Reports
* Scope
* Devices
* Users
* Audit log

These terms must appear identically in UI, documentation, PDFs, and the marketing site.

Forbidden: synonyms such as “attachments”, “proof”, “files”, “entries”, “objects”, or “supporting documents” when referring to evidence.

#### 4. Action names

Actions use imperative form without conversational cushioning.
Examples:

* Add device
* Upload evidence
* Review answers
* Export report
* Delete entry

Not permitted:
“Let’s add your device”, “Go ahead and…”, “You’re ready to upload”.

#### 5. Internal system names

Terms such as tenant, environment names, pipelines, and internal identifiers may appear only in technical documentation (SAIS, developer notes).
They must never appear in user-facing or marketing content.

### 2.3.2 Terminology Consistency

#### 1. One term per concept

Each concept has exactly one name.
It is used everywhere without synonyms or contextual alternatives.

#### 2. Framework naming

External frameworks are written in their canonical forms:

* Cyber Essentials
* Cyber Essentials Plus
* NIS2
* UK GDPR
* IEC 62443

Never abbreviate Cyber Essentials as CE in user-facing content.
Never invent stylised forms (“NIS-2”, “GDPR UK”).

#### 3. Organisation vs tenant

“Organisation” is the public-facing term.
“Tenant” is technical and used only in architectural and engineering contexts.

#### 4. Status language

Statuses must be mutually exclusive, literal, and easily understood:

* Not started
* In progress
* Pending review
* Completed

Avoid vague or expressive terms such as “Active”, “Ongoing”, “Almost there”, or “Working on it”.

#### 5. Time language

Use precise time expressions (e.g., “within 2 minutes”, “7 days”).
Avoid vague expressions such as “soon”, “shortly”, or “in a while”.

#### 6. Regulatory wording

Terms that may imply legal guidance must be used with care and remain consistent.
Where ambiguity exists, use the regulator’s original phrasing.

#### 7. Environment names

Local, Dev, Staging, and Production are internal references only.
They may not appear in customer-facing copy or reports.

#### 8. Terminology changes are versioned

Any change to naming must be deliberate, justified, updated across all surfaces, and logged under §10.4 Versioning and Release Management.

#### 9. Deterministic vocabulary

Vocabulary must remain stable.
No contextual renaming, no tone-based variants, no creative rephrasing.
This ensures consistent comprehension and aligns with deterministic system behaviour.

---

## 2.4 Tagline and Messaging Framework

Transcrypt’s tagline and messaging framework defines the core verbal statements through which the brand expresses its purpose. These messages are not marketing slogans or emotional appeals; they are structured, literal, and system-aligned summaries of the PRD’s intent, the SAIS’s architectural guarantees, and the PDS’s behavioural constraints.
Every public surface — homepage, app chrome, PDFs, documentation, slides, social — must draw from this framework to ensure consistent, predictable, and untheatrical communication. Messaging may not embellish, dramatise, or reinterpret the product’s purpose. It must remain grounded, clear, and calm at all times.

### 2.4.1 Tagline System

#### 1. Primary tagline

A single, high-level line used in hero surfaces, introduction blocks, and top-level presentations. It must be literal, calm, and aligned with Transcrypt’s structural promise.

Examples of permitted forms:

* **Compliance, without the confusion.**
* **Clear. Measurable. Repeatable.**
* **A simple, structured path to compliance.**
* **Compliance you can prove.**

The primary tagline must avoid hype, metaphor, emotional tone, or exaggerated claims. It may not imply AI magic, dramatic transformation, superior speed, or any capability not defined in the PRD or SAIS.

#### 2. Secondary taglines

Short supporting lines used in feature sections, subpages, documentation headers, or deck subtitles. These reinforce the core promise but remain restrained and factual.

Examples:

* **Structured workflows for real organisations.**
* **Evidence handled safely and consistently.**
* **Clear tasks. Predictable progress.**
* **Designed for SMEs.**

Secondary taglines must not drift stylistically from the primary tone. They expand context but do not reinterpret the product.

#### 3. Tagline constraints

All taglines must:

* use plain language
* make no unverified claims
* avoid emotional colour
* avoid metaphor
* avoid theatrics or inspirational phrasing
* match the Messaging Pillars in §1
* remain stable across surfaces
* be version-controlled if changed

No tagline may suggest outcomes the product cannot guarantee.

### 2.4.2 Messaging Architecture

The messaging architecture defines the structured hierarchy that governs how Transcrypt communicates across all channels. It prevents drift, ensures clarity, and ties all public statements back to the same small set of permitted ideas.

#### 1. Core promise

The top-level message all communication must reinforce.
Permitted examples:

* **Transcrypt removes uncertainty from cybersecurity compliance.**
* **A clear, structured way to achieve compliance.**

This message must remain literal, neutral, and grounded in the PRD.

#### 2. Message pillars

Every substantive message must align directly with one of the following:

* Clarity over complexity
* Trust through structure
* Guided, not overwhelming
* Confidence, not guesswork
* Built for real organisations

These pillars act as the foundation of all long-form and short-form messaging.

#### 3. Explanatory messaging

Used in product pages, documentation intros, onboarding, and presentations.
Characteristics:

* short
* factual
* non-emotive
* describes behaviour, not aspiration

Examples:

* **Transcrypt shows what needs to be done and why it matters.**
* **Evidence is stored and handled consistently.**
* **Progress is always visible.**

#### 4. Micro-messaging

Used in UI, email notifications, PDF exports, and support templates.
Examples:

* **Report generated.**
* **Pending review.**
* **Task completed.**

Micro-messaging must remain strictly literal and free from personality or warmth.

#### 5. Forbidden messaging patterns

The following are prohibited on all surfaces:

* emotional appeals (“Don’t worry”, “You’ve got this”)
* hype language (“transformative”, “revolutionary”)
* fear-based messaging (“Your business is at risk!”)
* metaphors (“compliance journey”, “unlock your potential”)
* conversational tone (“Let’s get started”)
* vague claims (“industry-leading platform”)
* expressive or theatrical phrasing

All messaging must remain neutral and factual.

#### 6. Deterministic messaging rules

Messaging must be stable across contexts and time.
Permitted statements cannot be stylised, remixed, or rewritten based on channel or audience.
Copy must reflect the same steady voice everywhere, matching the deterministic posture of the product.

#### 7. Versioning

Changes to taglines, message pillars, or architectural messaging require:

* justification
* review against PRD, SAIS, and PDS
* system-wide updates
* inclusion in §10.4 Versioning and Release Management

---

# 3. Logo System

The logo system defines the *fixed, non-negotiable* visual core of Transcrypt.
Where typography, colour, and layout establish tone, the logo system establishes identity: the symbolic anchor that carries the ideas of **sealed tenancy**, **containment**, and **deterministic structure** wherever the platform appears.

This is not a creative playground and not a family of “fun alternates.”
It is a governed asset: one primary mark, a tightly constrained set of secondary forms, and explicit rules for when each may be used. Every logo file in this section exists to prevent improvisation and to ensure that the brand expresses the same structural logic as the product and the architecture behind it.

The Transcrypt monogram is built on symmetry, figure–ground clarity, and controlled negative space. Its geometry reflects the platform’s engineering principles:

* **Symmetry** mirrors determinism, repeatability, and predictable outcomes.
* **Vertical forms** reflect the audit spine: the unbroken path from requirement to verification.
* **The enclosing arc** represents blast-radius containment and secure tenancy boundaries.
* **Negative space** carries as much meaning as the filled forms, echoing the platform’s emphasis on visibility, absence of drift, and unambiguous separation.

The rules that follow specify:

* the **primary logo** and its approved orientations,
* the **secondary and compact marks**,
* the precise **clearspace and minimum sizes**,
* the **restricted conditions** under which colour or orientation may change,
* and the explicit catalogue of **incorrect usages**.

Nothing outside these rules is permitted.
Nothing inside these rules may be altered, redrawn, recoloured, recombined, or “interpreted.”
This ensures that every appearance of Transcrypt — in UI, documentation, marketing, partner materials, or third-party environments — reflects the same engineered consistency as the platform itself.

---

## 3.1 Primary Logo

The primary logo is the authoritative expression of the Transcrypt identity. It consists of the monogram symbol — a precise geometric form built on symmetry, negative space, and controlled counter-shapes — paired with the Transcrypt wordmark in a fixed relationship. All other marks derive from this master asset and may not alter its proportions, geometry, or internal spacing.

The monogram embodies the engineering principles that underpin the platform: determinism, separation, and sealed tenancy. Its mirrored vertical structures reflect repeatability and internal order; the outer curvature conveys containment and controlled blast-radius boundaries; the negative space resolves into implicit letterforms only when the geometry is intact. Any distortion, recolouring, rotation, or reinterpretation breaks the mark’s logic and is not permitted.

The primary logo is used for all high-visibility brand surfaces, including the marketing site, product entry points, documentation covers, partnership decks, and any environment where Transcrypt must be unmistakably identified. It is also the reference asset from which secondary and compact variants inherit scale, spacing, stroke behaviour, and contrast conditions.

Only the approved files provided in the brand asset library may be used. Manual redrawing, recombination, or typesetting around the symbol is prohibited. The following subsections define its approved colour variants and the only valid orientations and lockups.

---

### 3.1.1 Colour Variants

Colour variations exist to maintain clarity, contrast, and structural integrity of the monogram under different lighting conditions and background surfaces. They are not stylistic options. Each variant is a functional state of the same symbol, governed by strict rules to preserve the geometry, figure–ground balance, and recognisability of the mark.

#### **Primary Black**

The default form of the logo is solid black. This variant preserves the maximum fidelity of the monogram’s counter-shapes and delivers the strongest figure–ground separation. It is the standard for all marketing, product, and documentation surfaces where a light or neutral background is used.

#### **Primary White (Inverse)**

The inverse white variant is used on dark or saturated brand backgrounds. It does not introduce alternate strokes or outlines; the geometry remains identical to the black version, simply expressed in reverse polarity. This variant exists solely to maintain accessibility and contrast compliance.

#### **Single-Colour Accent Variant**

A single-colour accent version may be used in controlled environments where colour harmonisation is required inside the product UI. This variant uses exactly one approved brand colour and must pass the same contrast criteria as the primary black and white forms. It cannot be used for marketing, external collateral, or any context where the logo functions as a primary identifier.

#### **Restrictions**

These constraints apply to every colour state without exception:

* No gradients, textures, transparencies, shadows, glows, or stroke effects.
* No multicolour combinations or experimental palettes.
* No low-contrast applications on photography, patterned surfaces, or tinted overlays unless the logo is placed inside an approved solid container.
* No recolouring by third parties; only the defined variants may be used.

The logo is a structural glyph, not a decorative graphic. Its colour states exist to defend clarity and recognisability, not to express mood or style.

---

### 3.1.2 Orientation and Lockups

The primary logo has a single correct orientation and a strictly limited set of approved lockups. These constraints protect the structural logic of the monogram — its symmetry, counter-form balance, and implied letterforms — and ensure that the logo behaves predictably across every surface.

#### **Upright Orientation**

The monogram exists in one orientation only: upright, with verticals aligned to the Cartesian grid. Rotating, skewing, or mirroring the form disrupts the negative-space relationships and breaks the implicit T/C reading.
The logo must never be angled, tilted, or placed on a sloped baseline.

#### **Horizontal Lockup**

The horizontal lockup pairs the monogram on the left with the Transcrypt wordmark on the right. It is the default arrangement for marketing surfaces, web headers, product entry points, documentation covers, and any environment where clear linear reading is required.
Spacing between the monogram and the wordmark is fixed and defined by the clearspace system in § 3.3; it may not be altered or visually “nudged.”

#### **Vertical Lockup**

The vertical lockup centres the monogram above the wordmark. This arrangement is used in tall or square formats: onboarding screens, splash pages, posters, social media tiles, and compressed layout blocks where the horizontal lockup loses presence.
The vertical lockup maintains the same proportional relationship between symbol and wordmark as the horizontal version and must be used exactly as supplied.

#### **Restrictions**

These rules apply to all lockups:

* No custom arrangements, re-stacking, or intermediary configurations.
* No placing the wordmark above the monogram, or beside it on the right.
* No surrounding text, taglines, or descriptors unless using an approved lockup containing them.
* No changes to the spacing, scale ratio, or alignment relationship between symbol and wordmark.
* No third-party “optimised” or redrawn lockups; the distributed assets are the only valid versions.

The lockup system is deliberately minimal and deterministic. It ensures that the logo maintains the same structural logic wherever it appears — whether in tight UI environments or full-width marketing layouts.

---

## 3.2 Secondary and Compact Logos

Secondary and compact logos are functional reductions of the Transcrypt monogram. They exist to maintain brand continuity in environments where the full primary lockup either does not fit or would compromise clarity. These forms are not alternatives, stylistic variations, or interpretive marks. They are context-specific expressions of the same geometry that defines the primary symbol.

The secondary mark uses the monogram alone. Compact marks apply this same geometry at extreme scales or inside constrained shapes, with only the minimum stroke or pixel compensation required for legibility. No other simplification or reinterpretation is permitted. Every variant inherits directly from `tc.svg` and must preserve the monogram’s symmetry, counterform logic, and negative-space balance.

---

### **3.2.1 Use Cases**

Secondary and compact marks serve environments where clarity, scale, or system integration demands a symbol-only representation of Transcrypt. Each use case is strictly defined.

#### **Application Shell and Navigation**

Inside the Essentials app and future modules, the monogram functions as the anchor for the product’s interface:

* Top-left app shell logo at 24–32px.
* Collapsed sidebar mode, where only icons are visible.
* Navigation drawers, mobile headers, and compact UI states.

The symbol provides a stable point of orientation without overwhelming functional UI.

#### **Small-Scale and Micro-Scale Icons**

At very small sizes — favicons, pinned shortcuts, toolbar icons — a compact version of the monogram is used. This variant retains the exact silhouette of the monogram with stroke or pixel-fitting adjustments only where required for raster clarity.

Examples include:

* Browser tabs (16px / 32px).
* OS-level pinned or shortcut icons.
* Compact in-product status markers or badges.

The geometry remains the same; only technical compensations differ.

#### **Technical Documentation and Diagrams**

The symbol is used as a structural anchor in diagrams and schematics in the SAIS, PDS, and operational documentation:

* Identification of Transcrypt’s trust boundary.
* Label for orchestrators, policy engines, or tenant isolation components.
* Visual reinforcement of “Transcrypt realm” within architectural compositions.

Its purpose is to signal system ownership, not to act as decoration.

#### **Identity Touchpoints and Avatars**

In contexts where brand representation must be compact — social profiles, internal communications platforms, partner dashboards — the monogram may be placed within an approved square or circular container.

Use cases include:

* LinkedIn or GitHub organisation avatars.
* Slack, Teams, or Discord workspace icons.
* Identity thumbnails in partner systems.

These avatars are not marketing assets; they are only for identity presence.

---

### **3.2.2 Restrictions**

Secondary and compact marks are tightly controlled to prevent fragmentation, reinterpretation, or brand drift.

#### **No Alternate Symbols**

There are no micro-logos, shortforms, cropped arcs, isolated stems, or simplified shapes.
The monogram is the monogram.
Every secondary or compact form must derive directly from its geometry.

#### **No Replacement of the Primary Logo**

Secondary or compact marks cannot be used:

* On marketing site heroes or headers.
* On external proposals or executive decks.
* On product launch surfaces or public-facing documentation covers.
* In any environment where Transcrypt must be introduced, not merely recognised.

The primary lockup is used for brand introduction.
The monogram-only mark is used for brand continuity.

#### **No Unapproved Containers or Shapes**

The monogram may not be placed inside arbitrary shapes such as capsules, rounded rectangles, hexagons, or decorative frames.
Only the approved square or circular containers for avatars and app icons are permitted.

#### **No Colour Deviation**

Secondary and compact marks follow the same colour rules as § 3.1.1:

* Black, white, or the single approved accent.
* No gradients, shadows, glows, or overlays.
* No recolouring by partners, vendors, or customer systems.

#### **No Alteration of Ratios or Stroke Geometry**

Except for the minimal stroke adjustments defined for micro-scale clarity:

* No thickening or thinning of strokes.
* No widening or compressing of the symbol.
* No rounding, softening, or redrawing of corners.
* No substituting geometric primitives.

The symbol’s proportions are invariant.
Pixel-fitting is a technical adjustment, not a design reinterpretation.

---

## 3.3 Clearspace and Minimum Size

Clearspace and minimum size rules exist to protect the structural logic of the Transcrypt monogram. Because the mark relies on symmetry, negative space, and tight internal ratios, it cannot survive crowding, compression, or overly small deployments without losing its implicit T/C reading and its sense of sealed containment. These rules define the minimum conditions under which the logo remains legible, recognisable, and consistent across all surfaces.

Clearspace protects the integrity of the mark in layout systems. Minimum sizes protect it in scale systems. Together, they ensure the logo maintains its engineered clarity whether used in marketing surfaces, product interfaces, or micro-scale iconography.

---

### **3.3.1 Clearspace Rules**

Clearspace acts as the “safety buffer” around the monogram and the primary lockup. It prevents surrounding elements from interfering with the counterforms that make the mark work. Because the monogram is defined by its internal void and its mirrored verticals, proximity to text, UI elements, or graphic noise can distort its reading and visually collapse the negative space.

#### **Defining the Clearspace Unit**

The clearspace unit is derived from the monogram’s own geometry to keep the rule proportional, not arbitrary.

**X = the width of one vertical stem of the monogram.**
This is a stable internal dimension that scales cleanly across all variants and ensures the protective zone feels balanced at any size.

#### **Primary Lockup Clearspace**

The primary logo (monogram + wordmark) requires clearspace of:

* **1X** on all sides for standard use.
* **2X** on hero surfaces, document covers, and marketing placements where breathing room reinforces authority and presence.

No external text, logos, UI elements, illustrations, or controls may enter the clearspace zone.
No optical adjustments are permitted; the clearspace is measured strictly from the bounding box.

#### **Secondary Mark Clearspace**

The symbol-only version uses the same clearspace unit:

* **1X** minimum clearspace on all sides.

When used in product UI (nav bars, drawers, sidebars), the clearspace may tighten slightly to **0.5X** if constrained by layout components, but only within the product interface — never in marketing or external collateral.

#### **Containered Icons**

Square or circular avatar icons inherit the same internal padding:

* The symbol must sit inside its container with **0.75X** internal padding to prevent edge crowding.

This prevents cramped avatars and preserves the silhouette even when cropped to small resolutions.

---

### **3.3.2 Minimum Size Specifications**

Minimum size requirements ensure that the monogram and lockups remain readable and structurally intact as they scale down. The goal is not merely “visible shape” but preservation of the counterform logic that gives the mark its character.

#### **Primary Lockup Minimum Sizes**

To maintain readability of both the monogram and the wordmark:

* **Digital minimum width:**
  **120px** for desktop, **96px** for mobile.
  Below this, the wordmark loses clarity and the monogram begins to crowd the spacing.

* **Print minimum width:**
  **35mm**.
  Anything smaller should use the symbol-only secondary mark.

#### **Secondary Monogram Minimum Sizes**

The monogram alone is more tolerant of small-scale use but still has a lower bound:

* **UI minimum:**
  **24px** for interface chrome, navigation anchors, and badge-level indicators.
  Below this, fine negative space collapses.

* **Documentation minimum:**
  **20px** when used as a diagram anchor or system label.

#### **Compact and Micro-Scale Icons**

For extremely small deployments, a technically compensated variant (`tc-favicon.svg`) is used to maintain silhouette recognition:

* **Favicon minimum:**
  **16px**, with pixel-fitting strokes.

* **Pinned / shortcut icons:**
  **32px** and above.

No other geometry changes are permitted. The favicon variant is a functional render, not a separate symbol.

---

## 3.4 Incorrect Usage Examples

Incorrect usage compromises the structural logic of the Transcrypt monogram and weakens its ability to function as a precise, engineered identifier. The monogram relies on specific internal ratios, consistent counterforms, and exact geometry. Any distortion, recolouring, or unauthorised manipulation breaks these relationships and creates a diluted or counterfeit version of the mark. The examples in this section define prohibited treatments so the logo remains uncompromised across all environments.

---

### **3.4.1 Distortion and Rotation**

Distortion of any kind destroys the monogram’s symmetry and the implicit T/C structure encoded in its negative space. Rotation breaks the vertical alignment that defines the mark and collapses its internal tension.

The following are strictly prohibited:

#### **Stretching or Squashing**

Changing the horizontal or vertical proportions alters stroke thickness, disrupts counterforms, and breaks the intended geometry.
The logo must never be compressed, expanded, squeezed, or stretched — even “slightly” for layout convenience.

#### **Rotation**

The monogram must remain upright at all times.
No rotation, angling, tilting, or diagonal placement is allowed.
Even small-degree rotations distort the vertical spine and disrupt the perception of structural containment.

#### **Skewing or Perspective Transformations**

Shearing, slanting, applying perspective, or simulating 3D depth destroys the axial symmetry and violates the deterministic engineering character of the mark.

#### **Cropping or Partial Display**

The monogram must never be cropped, cut off, or shown as a fragment (e.g., just the arc, just one stem).
This breaks the figure–ground relationships that give the mark meaning.

#### **Reconstruction or Redrawing**

No redrawing, re-spacing, approximations, “cleanups,” or designer reinterpretations.
The only valid geometry is the one provided in the official assets.

---

### **3.4.2 Colour Misuse**

The monogram’s clarity depends not only on geometry but also on correct colour contrast. Because the mark operates through negative space and silhouette, colour misuse quickly collapses its readability or causes the shape to visually merge with its surroundings.

The following treatments are prohibited:

#### **Non-Brand Colours**

The logo must not appear in arbitrary colours, gradients, tints, pastels, overlays, or promotional palettes.
Only pure black, pure white, or the approved single-colour accent are permitted.

#### **Low-Contrast Placement**

Using the monogram on backgrounds that do not provide sufficient contrast — such as mid-tone greys, busy textures, coloured photographs, or patterned surfaces — is not allowed unless placed within an approved solid container.

#### **Effects and Filters**

No shadows, glows, blurs, outer strokes, embossing, neon effects, or transparency.
These treatments introduce visual noise and undermine the symbol’s precision.

#### **Layering or Masking Experiments**

The logo must not be used as a mask for images, gradients, illustrations, or videos.
It is not a decorative frame or pattern; it is a controlled glyph.

#### **Unapproved Containers**

The monogram may not be placed inside arbitrary shapes (rounded rectangles, capsules, hexagons, abstract containers).
Only the sanctioned square or circular avatar containers are allowed.

# 4. Colour Palette

Colour in Transcrypt’s identity is not an expressive layer. It is a functional system that supports clarity, hierarchy, and reliability across every surface — from the marketing site to the Essentials app to PDF exports and architectural documentation. The palette exists to reinforce Transcrypt’s role as *boring, safe infrastructure*: predictable, legible, and free from aesthetic noise.

The product is built on determinism, sealed data boundaries, and unambiguous truth. The colour system mirrors that behaviour. It uses a restrained set of tones, chosen not for personality but for their ability to organise information and maintain consistency across light and dark environments.

The palette has three structural layers:

1. **Primary colours** — the deep engineered base, white/near-white surfaces, and a single cerulean accent that acts as the system’s point of focus.
2. **Secondary colours** — functional tones for semantic states, diagrams, and supporting UI, never competing with the primary accent.
3. **Neutral foundations** — a greyscale that provides depth, spacing, and hierarchy without drawing attention to itself.

Colour is applied sparingly, with strict contrast rules, minimal decorative usage, and a bias toward monochrome forms wherever clarity would benefit. The logo’s silhouette and the system’s typography remain the anchors; colour supports them, never leads.

This section defines the palette, its hierarchy, and the constraints governing its use, so Transcrypt’s identity remains stable, serious, and unmistakably technical — whatever surface it appears on.

---

## 4.1 Primary Brand Palette

The primary palette defines the core colours that carry Transcrypt’s identity across all surfaces. These colours set the tonal temperature of the brand: cold, precise, and deliberately restrained. They form the visual spine from which every other colour decision derives.

Transcrypt uses a minimal primary set: a deep engineered base, clean light surfaces for clarity, and a single cerulean accent that acts as the system’s point of focus. Each colour has a clearly defined role. The base establishes authority and stability; the light surfaces handle legibility and layout structure; the accent provides directional emphasis without introducing emotion or stylistic noise.

The primary palette is intentionally narrow. It ensures that the brand remains consistent whether rendered in UI chrome, PDF exports, diagrams, or physical materials. Everything outside these core colours is secondary, functional, or prohibited.

---

### 4.1.1 Core Colours

The core colours define the minimal set of tones that represent Transcrypt in every context where the brand must be unmistakable. Each colour has a defined, non-negotiable purpose. Nothing outside this set carries brand identity.

#### **Engineered Base**

A deep, near-black blue forms the base of the identity.
It is the backdrop for hero surfaces, product chrome, and structural components where authority and clarity matter.
This tone anchors the entire system and ensures that the brand reads as a stable piece of infrastructure rather than a decorative interface.

The engineered base is never used as an accent, never softened, and never tinted. Its job is to hold the frame.

#### **Light Surfaces**

White and near-white surfaces provide the clarity layer of the brand.
These values control content-heavy environments — documentation, data tables, PDF exports, dashboards, and any space where reading comfort outranks atmosphere.

They exist purely for legibility and spatial structure.
They do not function as accents and they do not attempt to carry emotion.

#### **Cerulean Accent**

The single point of colour in the primary palette is a controlled cerulean — a mid-spectrum blue chosen for its engineered neutrality.
It carries no emotional overtones and does not behave like a marketing highlight.
Its purpose is functional:

* to draw attention to interactive elements,
* to denote focus or state transitions,
* to mark calls to action,
* to guide the user in complex flows.

The accent always works in a trio: base, light surface, cerulean.
It is never paired with additional accents and never used as a background.
Its variants (soft, deep) support accessibility and hierarchy but remain within the same hue family.

#### **Black and White Extremes**

Pure black and pure white are retained as functional extremes for typography, diagrams, and high-contrast environments.
They are not brand colours but operational tools, ensuring that text, icons, and schematics remain razor-clear across all surfaces.

---

### 4.1.2 Palette Meaning and Associations

The colours in Transcrypt’s primary palette are chosen for their behavioural qualities, not their aesthetic personality. Each tone carries a specific operational meaning that aligns with the product’s purpose: clarity, stability, and predictable behaviour in environments where ambiguity creates risk.

#### **Engineered Base — Stability and Containment**

The deep engineered base represents structural integrity.
It echoes the sealed nature of Transcrypt’s tenants and the immutability of stored evidence.
It is the visual metaphor for “the boundary”: the line between what is inside the system and what is not.
This colour signals seriousness, focus, and the absence of ornamentation.
It does not attempt to evoke emotion — it suppresses it.

#### **Light Surfaces — Clarity and Inspection**

White and near-white surfaces represent inspection, legibility, and audit-friendly visibility.
They reflect the product’s core mission: making truth easier to see.
These colours support reading, comparison, annotation, and long-form documentation without fatigue.
They are not expressive; they are deliberately neutral, creating an environment where content, not colour, carries meaning.

#### **Cerulean Accent — Direction and Intent**

Cerulean serves as a single point of controlled emphasis.
It directs the eye without shouting, allowing the system to guide attention in a calm, engineered way.
It is used where the user’s next step needs to be clear: calls to action, selected states, interactive surfaces, progress indicators.
Cerulean is chosen for its neutrality — cooler than consumer blue, warmer than instrument cyan — a technical midpoint that conveys “this is the thing to pay attention to” without signalling urgency, emotion, or brand personality.

This accent is not decorative.
Its meaning is consistent wherever it appears: **focus here**.

#### **Black and White Extremes — Precision and Truth**

Pure black and pure white are functional extremes used for typography, diagrams, and schematic elements where precision matters more than mood.
They represent binary clarity: on/off, true/false, present/absent.
In documentation and technical materials, these colours reinforce the determinism at the heart of the product.

---

## 4.2 Secondary Palette

The secondary palette supports the product’s functional needs without ever competing with the primary colours. These tones are not part of Transcrypt’s identity; they are part of its interface logic. Their job is to communicate state, hierarchy, and system meaning in environments where monochrome alone is insufficient.

Secondary colours exist only to improve comprehension. They never introduce personality, and they never dilute the authority of the primary palette.

---

### **4.2.1 Supporting Colours**

The supporting colours are a tightly constrained set of functional tones used for semantics, data visualisation, and system feedback. They follow three principles:

1. **Functional, not expressive** — every tone corresponds to a precise meaning.
2. **Subordinate to the accent** — nothing in this set may resemble or compete with cerulean.
3. **Neutral until required** — these colours appear only when they serve a clear informational purpose.

The typical categories include:

#### **Success / Confirmation**

A muted green family used only to communicate “this state is valid, complete, or healthy.”
Greens are subdued and never bright. They reinforce correctness without introducing exuberance or emotional positivity.

#### **Warning / Caution**

An amber family used to signal conditions that require attention but do not represent failure.
These tones echo industrial caution systems — neither playful nor alarming, simply informative.

#### **Error / Failure**

A disciplined, desaturated red used exclusively for errors, failed checks, invalid evidence, or blocked actions.
No gradient, no glow, no emotional theatrics — just clear, immediate signalling.

#### **Diagrammatic Neutrals**

A narrow set of greys or muted blues used in architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and PDS/SAIS illustrations.
Their purpose is structural clarity, not identity.

These tones sit behind the brand; they never define it.

---

### **4.2.2 Use Cases**

Supporting colours appear only in contexts where the user needs clear, fast interpretation of system state, or where data representation requires additional visual channels.

#### **Semantic States in the Essentials App**

Each supporting colour maps to a single semantic domain:

* Success → evidence complete, evaluation ready
* Warning → expiring exceptions, incomplete prompts, upcoming deadlines
* Error → blocked runs, invalid evidence, permission issues

These mappings are fixed and universal.
A colour may not be reinterpreted.

#### **System Feedback and Notifications**

Secondary colours are used sparingly in:

* alerts
* banners
* inline validation messages
* status chips
* logs and change history markers

The hierarchy is always:
**base → light → accent → secondary (only for state).**

#### **Data Visualisation and Diagrams**

Charts, progress meters, and SAIS/PDS diagrams may use supporting colours only when needed for differentiation:

* categories in bar charts
* thresholds in compliance readiness
* steps in evaluation pipelines
* architectural boundaries

No chart may use the primary accent unless it represents action or focus.
The accent’s role remains protected.

#### **Documentation and Exports**

In PDFs, reports, and printed material, secondary colours remain muted to ensure:

* legible contrast
* high reproduction accuracy
* compatibility with grayscale printing
* no drift into marketing-style colour storytelling

Supporting colours never appear as backgrounds or large surfaces.

# 6. Iconography and Illustration Style

Transcrypt’s icon system is built on Feather Icons (MIT-licensed) as the sole icon source. Feather provides the geometric base: a 24×24 grid, minimal outlines, and neutral metaphors. Icons are selected from Feather as needed, lightly adjusted where required, and saved as local SVG assets in the repo. All icons used in Transcrypt must conform to the rules in this section, regardless of their origin.

## 6.1 Icon Style Principles

Icons in Transcrypt are simple, neutral line icons based on a 24×24 grid. The visual model is derived from Feather Icons: clean outlines, no fills by default, and no expressive or playful metaphors. Icons exist to support comprehension, not to add character or decoration.

All icons must:
- Use a 24×24 canvas
- Follow a single, consistent stroke weight
- Avoid texture, gradients, shadows, and depth
- Use widely recognised metaphors only
- Remain visually quiet and subordinate to typography and layout

## 6.5 Icon Usage Rules

Transcrypt uses Feather Icons (MIT licensed) as the sole source for all icons in product, marketing, and documentation. Icons are used directly from the Feather set, with adjustments only when required for clarity or alignment.

### 6.5.1 Source of Truth

All icons used in the product must be stored locally in the repository under:

/assets/icons/

This ensures visibility, consistency, and reusability.

### 6.5.2 Usage Approach

Icons are selected from Feather as needed. Adjustments are permitted for:

- Stroke weight alignment  
- Corner consistency  
- Metaphor clarity  

Raw Feather icons should not be used directly from the CDN or package. Always place the final SVG in the repo.

### 6.5.3 Style Alignment

All icons must:

- Use a 24×24 grid  
- Maintain consistent outline stroke weight  
- Avoid fills, colour variations, gradients, or expressive metaphors  
- Remain neutral and functional in tone  

### 6.5.4 No Icon Approval Workflow

As a single-designer system, no formal icon approval or governance process exists. The repository history provides the audit trail.

### 6.5.5 Adding New Icons

When a new icon is needed:

1. Select or adapt a Feather icon.  
2. Add it to `/assets/icons/`.  
3. Use it wherever required.

Icons do not require a pre-defined inventory.

## 8.7 Wireframes and Structural Examples

Wireframes visualise Transcrypt’s structural logic without the distraction of colour, typography, or imagery. They are functional blueprints — tools for communicating layout rhythm, information hierarchy, spacing, and behavioural patterns before visual styling is applied.
They exist to ensure that every surface designed under the Transcrypt brand inherits the same clarity, calmness, and predictable flow defined in the PDS and reinforced by this guide.

Wireframes are **not** creative artefacts.
They are structural evidence of adherence to the system.

### **8.7.1 Purpose of Wireframes**

Wireframes serve as the intermediate layer between layout rules (Section 8.1–8.4) and real-world marketing or application surfaces (Section 9). Their purpose is to:

* Validate the spatial grid in real contexts
* Test information hierarchy before visual styling
* Expose layout issues early (density, imbalance, cognitive weight)
* Demonstrate correct use of spacing, rhythm, and block composition
* Provide partners and contractors with an unambiguous structural template

Every significant layout — page templates, dashboards, forms, modals, onboarding flows — must be wireframed before typography, colour, or imagery is applied.

### **8.7.2 Core Layout Wireframes**

Core layout wireframes illustrate the structural backbone of the brand. Every layout must obey:

* **Consistent grid usage:** 12-column default, with documented breakpoints
* **Predictable spacing:** following the fixed or modular scale defined in Section 8.3
* **Clean hierarchy:** one dominant H1 block, clear secondary blocks, and grouped tertiary elements
* **No visual noise:** whitespace is an active structural component, not an optional one

Core wireframes must be produced for:

* **Homepage framework** (hero zone, clarity block, CTA structure)
* **Content pages** (blog/article layouts)
* **Feature or landing pages**
* **Documentation-style layouts**
* **Dashboard or app pages** where relevant

Each wireframe shows *structure only* — boxes, labels, spacing, and flow.

### **8.7.3 Form and Flow Wireframes**

Forms and workflows have strict structural requirements due to Transcrypt’s purpose: reduce cognitive load and eliminate ambiguity.

Wireframes must demonstrate:

* **Single-column form layouts** for readability and clarity
* **Clear field grouping** using spacing, not borders
* **Minimal branching** in any given interaction
* **Predictable CTA placement:** right-aligned primary, left or centre secondary
* **Inline validation areas** that preserve rhythm and do not shift the layout erratically

Flow wireframes must include:

* **Step-by-step task flows**
* **Verification or review steps**
* **Progress indicators**
* **Error and fallback states**

These wireframes define behaviour and guidance long before visuals appear.

### **8.7.4 Do and Don’t Wireframe Patterns**

Wireframes must make acceptable and unacceptable patterns explicit.

**Acceptable:**

* Generous spacing
* Calm rhythm with minimal visual density
* One visual focus per screen
* Predictable alignment of elements
* Clear, unambiguous reading paths

**Forbidden:**

* Crowded layouts
* Overuse of columns (no multi-column forms)
* Excessive grouping lines or boxed sections
* Surprise elements (pop-ins, floating blocks, disconnected CTAs)
* Visually aggressive structures (tight density, inconsistent block widths)

Wireframes act as the inspection mechanism: if a layout doesn't wireframe cleanly, it will not behave cleanly once styled.

---

## **8.8 State and Mode Patterns**

State and mode patterns define how Transcrypt behaves in every non-ideal or transitional situation. These states carry significant brand weight: they influence user trust more than static surfaces. They must be calm, unambiguous, structured, and free of theatrics.
Every loading sequence, error message, success confirmation, or empty pattern must follow the same predictable rules to preserve the brand’s promise of clarity and confidence.

No state may introduce surprise, motion spikes, playful language, or unnecessary visual noise.

### **8.8.1 Loading States**

Loading patterns must:

* Use **minimal, low-motion indicators**
* Preserve layout structure; no content “jumping”
* Avoid skeleton screens unless the structural layout requires them
* Use neutral language: *“Loading…”*, *“Preparing view…”*
* Never use humour, filler text, or animations with character or personality

Loading indicators must not distract or imply instability.
No pulsing colour, no playful metaphors, no progress bars unless time is genuinely meaningful.

### **8.8.2 Empty States**

Empty states exist to reduce uncertainty. They must:

* Clearly state why the space is empty
* Provide one primary next action (e.g., “Add evidence”)
* Use short, directive copy
* Include a small visual indicator *only if it reinforces clarity*

Empty states must not use:

* Metaphors
* Illustrations implying emotion
* Humorous or “light” tone
* Decorative visuals

The intention is calm instruction, not engagement or entertainment.

### **8.8.3 Validation and Error States**

Error states must be clinical, factual, and free from dramatics.

Rules:

* Use **precise, actionable language**: *“This field is required.”*, *“Invalid email format.”*
* Avoid blame, personality, humour, or conversational flourishes
* Highlight only the affected element — no full-screen error patterns unless the system is genuinely unavailable
* Never animate errors; no shaking, bouncing, pulsing, or colour flashes

Colour use must follow Section 4.5 (Prohibited Applications):
Errors must meet WCAG; no high-saturation reds or flashing affordances.

### **8.8.4 Success and Confirmation States**

Success feedback must:

* Be minimal and brief
* Use clean, neutral confirmation: *“Saved.”*, *“Completed.”*
* Avoid celebratory icons, emojis, confetti, ticks with flourish, or bright colour flashes
* Maintain layout stability; do not shift the interface unnecessarily

Transcrypt does not do “congratulations,” “you’re all set!”, or any copy implying personality or emotional performance.

### **8.8.5 Pending, Review, and Intermediate States**

These states occur when work is in progress but not yet complete—especially relevant to compliance workflows.

Rules:

* Use precise descriptors: *“Pending review”*, *“Awaiting confirmation”*, *“In progress”*
* No metaphors about “journeys,” “paths,” or “processing magic”
* Maintain stable structure; avoid intermediate animations

If a user must wait for back-end operations, fallback messages must be clear and deterministic.

### **8.8.6 System-Level Error Modes**

For outages, integration failures, or major exceptions:

* Use structured, audit-aligned messaging
* Avoid blaming language or conversational tone
* Provide one clear fallback path
* Include an incident identifier for support

No humour, no brand personality, no flourish.
System errors represent reputational risk and must reinforce calm professionalism.

### **8.8.7 Interaction Modes**

Interaction modes define how users move through tasks:

* Focus states must be visible, WCAG-compliant, and restrained
* Hover states (desktop) must be minimal and avoid colour jumps
* Disabled states must be clearly distinguishable
* Active states must rely on structural cues, not strong colour

Modes must never introduce:

* Glow effects
* Neon accents
* Animated highlights
* Playful feedback

The product must remain calm at all times.

### **8.8.8 Fallback and No-JS States**

If JavaScript is disabled or fails:

* Primary content must remain readable
* Critical actions must degrade gracefully
* Errors must follow the same tone and structural rules

No fallback may present a broken or partially styled identity.

## 11.4 Icon and Illustration Files

Transcrypt uses Feather Icons (MIT licensed) as the sole icon source. Icons are added to the repository as needed and stored as standalone SVG files.

### 11.4.1 Icons

All icons used in the product or marketing materials must be saved in:

/assets/icons/

There is no predefined icon inventory. Icons are added on demand and should be selected from the Feather set unless a custom metaphor is required.

Rules:
- Use outline Feather icons (24×24 grid).
- Make small stroke/geometry adjustments only when required for clarity.
- Do not mix icon sets.
- Store each SVG in the repo; do not import from CDNs or packages at runtime.

### 11.4.2 Illustrations

Any custom illustrations or diagrams used in the product or documentation must be stored in:

/assets/illustrations/

Illustrations follow the style rules defined in Section 6 but do not require versioning or formal governance in a single-designer workflow.

# **13. Future Work**

This section outlines areas of the brand system that are intentionally deferred. They are not required for the stability, coherence, or correctness of the current identity. Each represents an extension that will become relevant as Transcrypt’s product surface grows, its marketing channels expand, or new operational needs emerge.
These items should be prioritised as the platform matures, new modules or tiers are introduced, or external demands justify additional identity layers.

Future work items must not be implemented ad-hoc. They require the same rigour, review, and versioning discipline defined in §10.4.

---

## **13.1 Data Visualisation Identity**

Transcrypt will eventually present structured progress indicators, audit-readiness scores, task completion ratios, and other compliance-related metrics.
A dedicated data visualisation identity will be required to define:

* Approved chart types
* Semantic colour mappings
* Minimum contrast and accessibility rules
* Motion restrictions
* Prohibited chart forms
* Structural templates for dashboards and reports

This work is deferred until visualisation becomes part of the product surface.

---

## **13.2 Illustration Scaling and Integration**

The current system defines illustration tone and metaphor. Future expansion will define:

* Scaling rules for mobile, cards, and hero surfaces
* Integration rules with photography
* Responsive behaviour
* Acceptable and prohibited styles for multi-illustration sets

This will be activated when illustration becomes a recurring pattern across marketing and product.

---

## **13.3 Sub-Brand and Tier Architecture**

As Transcrypt adds modules, feature tiers, or related products, a formal sub-brand strategy will be required. This includes:

* Naming conventions
* Colour or accent differentiation
* Typography accents
* Logo or lockup variations (if any)
* Rules preventing brand fragmentation

This will be developed when expansion beyond the Essentials App is planned.

---

## **13.4 Physical Space and Environmental Branding**

When Transcrypt first appears in physical environments — conferences, booths, signage, or printed events — additional guidance will be required for:

* Large-format typography
* Distance legibility
* Banner and backdrop layouts
* Physical material constraints
* Lighting and colour fidelity in real-world spaces

This is deferred until Transcrypt participates in live events.

---

## **13.5 Social Behaviour and Channel Identity**

While core templates exist in §9, a deeper behavioural identity for social channels will be needed as the brand’s public presence grows.
Future work will define:

* Posting tone
* Platform-specific constraints (LinkedIn, X, YouTube, etc.)
* Hashtag rules
* Reactive content guidance
* Image–text balance per channel
* Prohibited topics and formats

This becomes essential when daily or campaign-driven posting begins.

---

## **13.6 Design Tokenisation and Brand API**

As engineering and product UI surface expand, Transcrypt will require a design-token system that expresses:

* Semantic colour tokens
* Typography tokens
* Spacing and rhythm tokens
* Motion tokens
* JSON/CSS variable exports
* Versioned token distribution for developers

This is deferred until UI implementation begins at scale.

---

## **13.7 Brand Drift Detection and Automation**

To maintain long-term integrity, automated checks may be added to detect:

* Outdated logo files
* Deprecated colour values
* Incorrect typography usage
* Token drift in UI code
* Off-brand layouts in shared folders
* Missing attribution in imagery

This future capability extends the governance model in §10 and reinforces Transcrypt’s principle of deterministic brand expression.
