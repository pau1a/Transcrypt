# Brand Identity Guide

The Brand Identity Guide defines the visual and verbal system that represents Transcrypt everywhere it appears. It establishes the rules that make the brand coherent across product, marketing, documentation, demos, presentations, and future customer-facing surfaces.

Where the PRD defines purpose, the SAIS defines architecture, and the PDS defines behaviour, this guide defines expression — the consistent external face of a platform built on determinism, trust, and clarity.

This is not a creative exploration or a loose set of suggestions. It is an operational standard. Every logo file, colour token, typographic choice, spacing rule, illustration, and written sentence must follow the constraints in this guide. Any deviation introduces risk: inconsistency, dilution, misinterpretation, or loss of trust.

Transcrypt’s identity is built the same way its product is built — simple, disciplined, structured, and intolerant of ambiguity. The aim is not flashiness or novelty. The aim is precision, legibility, and a quiet confidence that reflects a platform designed to be safe, predictable, and uncompromising in how it handles customer data and compliance.

The rules here bind designers, writers, engineers, partners, and anyone creating assets on behalf of the company. The result is a single brand that looks, sounds, and behaves like one product, one philosophy, and one promise — wherever it appears.

# 1. Purpose and Positioning

Transcrypt exists to make cybersecurity compliance effortless, reliable, and unambiguous for small and mid-sized organisations. Its purpose is not to entertain, embellish, or posture — but to remove uncertainty, reduce cognitive load, and replace scattered processes with a single, trusted system. This guide defines how that purpose is expressed visually and verbally everywhere the brand appears.

The brand is not decorative. It is an operational tool. The same discipline that governs Transcrypt’s architecture, behaviour, and product decisions governs its identity. Every colour, word, typeface, spacing rule, and asset must serve clarity, trust, and precision. Nothing should distract from the product’s promise: predictable outcomes, verifiable progress, and a calm, structured experience in a domain normally defined by complexity and anxiety.

This section establishes the brand’s strategic position and the narrative foundation that all communication must follow. It prevents drift. It ensures that internal teams, partners, and external contributors reinforce a single, coherent story rather than inventing their own. What follows defines the purpose statement, positioning statement, core story, and messaging pillars — the story engine that drives every line of copy, every page layout, and every marketing asset.

### Purpose Statement

Transcrypt exists to give organisations a simple, trusted path to cybersecurity compliance — replacing confusion and manual effort with clarity, structure, and measurable progress.

### Positioning Statement

For UK SMEs who need to achieve and maintain cybersecurity certifications without specialist staff or bloated enterprise tooling, Transcrypt is the compliance platform that offers a guided, auditable, and stress-free experience. Unlike generic SaaS tools or consultancy-heavy approaches, Transcrypt is built on deterministic architecture, sealed tenancy, and transparent evidence handling, delivering confidence without complexity.

### Core Story

Most small organisations know they need to meet cybersecurity standards, but the process feels like a maze. Requirements are scattered. Evidence is inconsistent. People don’t know what “good” looks like, and the stakes of getting it wrong are high. Transcrypt brings order to this chaos. It guides users step-by-step, explains what matters and why, structures everything that needs to be collected, and turns messy progress into clear, demonstrable readiness. It removes guesswork. It removes fear. It shows organisations that compliance doesn’t have to be complicated — it just has to be structured. With Transcrypt, the path is always knowable, repeatable, and auditable.

### Key Messaging Pillars

These principles anchor every outward-facing message. They do not change.
They form the spine of the brand.

1. **Clarity over complexity**
   The product explains what needs to be done, why it matters, and how to do it — with no jargon, ambiguity, or hidden steps.

2. **Trust through structure**
   Deterministic workflows, sealed tenancy, verifiable evidence, and a predictable user experience make the platform dependable.

3. **Guided, not overwhelming**
   Transcrypt turns the compliance journey into a sequence of understandable tasks, each grounded in clear definitions and practical guidance.

4. **Confidence, not guesswork**
   Every action, artefact, and result is traceable. Users know where they stand, what’s left, and whether they’re ready.

5. **Built for real organisations**
   Designed for the workloads, constraints, and realities of SMEs — not as a stripped-down enterprise tool, but as a system with their world in mind.

Together, these elements define how the brand speaks, behaves, and appears. They set the tone for the rest of this guide and ensure Transcrypt’s identity is as precise, consistent, and dependable as the product itself.

## 1.1 Role of the Brand Identity Guide

This guide defines how Transcrypt presents itself visually and verbally across every surface. It establishes the rules that maintain coherence between product, marketing, documentation, and any future public-facing channels. Its role is to ensure the brand expresses the same philosophy everywhere: clarity, restraint, structure, and predictable behaviour.

### 1.1.1 Scope of the Guide

This guide defines:

* The visual identity: colour palette, typography, iconography, spacing, grid systems, layout structure.
* The verbal identity: tone of voice, writing rules, naming conventions, language constraints.
* The expression layer across all surfaces: website, product UI, docs, slide decks, assets, and external communication.
* The boundaries that prevent visual or tonal drift.
* The rules that designers, writers, engineers, and partners must follow when creating anything that represents Transcrypt.

It acts as the expression layer of the broader system defined by the PRD, SAIS, and PDS. Where those documents define purpose, architecture, and behaviour, this guide defines identity and presentation.

### 1.1.2 What the Guide Does Not Cover

This guide does not define:

* Product behaviour, user flows, or interaction logic (covered by the PDS).
* System architecture, tenancy model, data flow, or operational invariants (covered by the SAIS).
* Product strategy, feature scope, or the reasoning behind decisions (covered by the PRD).
* Commercial strategy, pricing, or go-to-market plans.
* Regulatory interpretation or compliance obligations.
* Engineering implementation details or code-level patterns.

The Brand Identity Guide controls *how* Transcrypt is expressed.
It does not decide *what* is built or *how* it works under the hood. It sits alongside PRD, SAIS, and PDS as a fourth pillar: expression, not architecture.

---

## 1.2 Relationship to PRD, SAIS, and PDS

The Brand Identity Guide is not an independent creative document. It is the final expression layer in a chain of upstream constraints. It inherits purpose from the PRD, system truth from the SAIS, and behavioural rules from the PDS. Nothing in this guide may contradict or reinterpret those documents. Its role is to translate them into a consistent visual and verbal identity across every surface where Transcrypt appears.

### 1.2.1 Upstream Document Dependency

The Brand Identity Guide depends directly on the three core Transcrypt documents:

#### PRD: Purpose, promise, and positioning

The PRD defines why Transcrypt exists, who it is for, and what outcomes it must guarantee.
The brand inherits these constraints. It may not introduce themes, claims, metaphors, or tones that extend beyond the PRD’s intent.
If the PRD does not promise a capability, the brand may not imply it.

#### SAIS: Architecture, invariants, and system truth

The SAIS defines sealed tenancy, deterministic behaviour, data isolation, evidence integrity, and the operational laws of the platform.
The brand must never conflict with these architectural truths.
If the SAIS defines low motion, strict isolation, or minimalism, the brand must reflect it.
Brand expression cannot violate the platform’s physics.

#### PDS: Behaviour, layout, and interaction rules

The PDS defines how the product behaves in a user’s hands: states, spacing, hierarchy, error models, motion limits, and interaction patterns.
The brand may define style and tone but must never override or contradict behavioural rules already codified in the PDS.
If the PDS prohibits theatrics, celebration, or emotional language, the brand inherits those prohibitions.

Together, these upstream documents form the non-negotiable substrate of the Brand Identity Guide.
This guide expresses the system; it does not invent its own.

### 1.2.2 Downstream Influence on Marketing and Product

Once defined, the Brand Identity Guide governs the expression layer across all downstream surfaces.
Every asset, interface, and communication must follow the rules set here.

This includes:

#### Marketing surfaces

Website, landing pages, blog, social media templates, advertising, presentations, print media, and any public-facing asset.
All must use the approved tone, typography, colour system, spacing rules, and structural patterns.

#### Product and application surfaces

UI, dashboards, forms, states, tables, navigation, diagrams, and in-product communication.
Styling, tone, iconography, layout choices, and visual metaphors must follow the guide exactly.
Behaviour continues to be governed by the PDS; visual and verbal expression is governed by this guide.

#### Documentation and communication

User guides, internal docs, onboarding materials, email notifications, PDF exports, and compliance-facing outputs.
These must adopt the same tone, typography, and visual identity to preserve consistency and trust.

The Brand Identity Guide is therefore the binding contract for expression across Transcrypt.
Upstream documents define intent, architecture, and behaviour.
This guide defines how they look, sound, and present themselves in every real-world context.

---

## 1.3 Intended Audience

The Brand Identity Guide exists to maintain a single, consistent expression of Transcrypt across every surface. Although Transcrypt is developed by one person, the guide must serve all present and future roles involved in creating, publishing, or automating branded assets. Its audience therefore includes internal roles, automated systems, and any future external contributors.

### 1.3.1 Internal Teams

“Internal teams” refers to every function involved in producing Transcrypt assets, even when those functions are carried out by a single individual. This includes:

#### 1. Core roles

Marketing, design, product, engineering, documentation, and operational communication.
Even when performed by one person, these roles require consistent rules to prevent context-switch drift or stylistic inconsistency.

#### 2. Functional personas

Operational personas such as Brian (public-facing marketing voice), Ged (technical collaborator), and Flash (diagram generation) must follow this guide exactly.
They do not have creative freedom; they inherit the brand constraints defined here.

#### 3. Automated systems

Static site generators, PDF export pipelines, template engines, CSS token systems, and any automated layout or content tools must pull their styling and tone from this guide.
Automation must not generate alternative styles or “interpretations”.

#### 4. Future roles

If additional help is added later—contractors, illustrators, editors, or virtual assistants—this guide provides the binding rules for their output.
No internal role, present or future, may deviate from the identity defined in this document.

### 1.3.2 External Partners

External partners include any party outside Transcrypt who produces, modifies, or distributes branded materials. Even if no such partners exist now, this guide defines the rules they must follow if they are engaged in the future.

#### 1. Scope of external work

This includes design contractors, marketing freelancers, print vendors, video editors, illustrators, and event organisers.
Any asset they create must conform to the rules defined here—typography, colour, layout, tone, spacing, and structural patterns.

#### 2. No creative reinterpretation

External partners are not permitted to “reinterpret” the brand, propose alternative directions, or introduce personal stylistic preferences.
The identity is a fixed system, not a collaborative exploration.

#### 3. Escalation requirements

If a rule is unclear or appears to be missing, external partners must seek clarification rather than guess.
Assumptions, approximations, or stylistic improvisations are not permitted.

#### 4. Compliance across mediums

The rules in this guide apply equally to digital, print, environmental, and social surfaces.
No external contributor may relax constraints for convenience, format, or familiarity.

---

## 1.4 Brand Philosophy and Identity Principles

The brand exists to reduce anxiety, not to add noise. Every design, copy, and interaction decision must respect the following principles:

1. **Clarity first**
   If a choice exists between clever wording and clear wording, clear wins. If a visual treatment risks confusion, it is not allowed. Users must always know where they are, what they are looking at, and what happens next.

2. **Calm by default**
   The product operates in stressful contexts: audits, incidents, deadlines. The brand must counter that stress, not amplify it. No loud colour clashes, no aggressive motion, no dramatic language. Calm, measured, and predictable at all times.

3. **Structure as reassurance**
   Grids, spacing, and hierarchy are not aesthetic flourishes; they are signals that the system is ordered, thought through, and safe to trust. Layouts must feel deliberate: consistent margins, predictable typography, and repeatable patterns across screens.

4. **Evidence over claims**
   Wherever possible, show rather than tell. Progress indicators, timelines, and clear status states are preferred over marketing promises. The brand earns trust by exposing structure and evidence, not by insisting on its own credibility.

5. **Neutral, human, and unbranded in tone**
   The voice is human but restrained: no slang, no memes, no “on-trend” phrasing that will date quickly. Transcrypt speaks like a calm specialist who has seen these problems before and can explain them without ego.

6. **Deterministic, not magical**
   Transcrypt is powered by solid architecture and clear workflows, not “black box” magic. Avoid metaphors that suggest guessing, intuition, or AI wizardry. Emphasise repeatability, auditability, and explicit rules.

7. **Single system, many surfaces**
   Marketing site, app UI, docs, emails, and decks are all expressions of one system. Designers and writers may not “reinvent” the brand for each surface. Local variation is allowed only where this guide explicitly permits it.

Any proposed deviation from these principles must be justified in writing and, if accepted, recorded as an explicit update under §10.4 Versioning and Release Management.

---

# 2. Core Brand Identity

Transcrypt’s identity is not an aesthetic choice; it is a structural expression of the system described in the PRD, SAIS, and PDS. Where those documents define purpose, architecture, and behaviour, this section defines the internal character of the brand — the values, tone, and personality constraints that shape every visual and verbal decision. These principles ensure Transcrypt expresses itself with the same clarity, discipline, and determinism that govern the product itself. Nothing here is optional or inspirational. These are the rules that anchor all expression across product, marketing, documentation, and future surfaces.

## 2.1 Brand Values and Personality

Transcrypt’s values and personality are grounded in the realities of security, compliance, and evidential systems. They reflect the calm, structured, and predictable nature of the platform, and they exist to minimise cognitive load, avoid theatrics, and maintain trust. These values flow directly from the architectural and behavioural constraints defined upstream; they are not creative inventions but system-derived requirements.

### 2.1.1 Primary Values

#### 1. Clarity

Every surface must prioritise readability, comprehension, and explicit meaning. The brand avoids ambiguity, jargon drift, decorative noise, and any element that obscures intent. Clarity is not a stylistic preference; it is a fulfilment of the PRD’s mandate to remove uncertainty and reduce cognitive load.

#### 2. Structure

Layouts, spacing, tone, and hierarchy must reflect the ordered, deterministic nature of the platform. Consistency is a security posture. The brand expresses this through predictable grids, stable tone, and unchanging rules.

#### 3. Trust

Trust is earned through visible restraint, reliability, and precision. The brand does not shout, oversell, or dramatise. It communicates as a steady, dependable system — the same way the architecture behaves.

#### 4. Neutrality

Transcrypt’s identity avoids emotional colour, humour, personality spikes, and conversational affect. Neutral language and calm visuals reduce stress and increase comprehension, which directly supports compliance workflows.

#### 5. Calm

Compliance and audits often create pressure. The brand counterbalances this with quiet surfaces, minimal motion, clear language, and stable layouts. Calmness is a functional requirement, not an aesthetic choice.

#### 6. Evidence over assertion

Statements are factual, grounded, and unexaggerated. The brand mirrors the evidence model in the product: claims are supported by structure, not flourish. Hyperbole, vague claims, and hype adjectives are prohibited.

#### 7. Discipline

Brand expression follows strict rules with no improvisation. Discipline ensures predictability and prevents drift as Transcrypt’s footprint expands. Every decision must reflect intentionality and constraint.

### 2.1.2 Emotional Tone

Transcrypt’s tone is the verbal reflection of its architecture: calm, neutral, and deterministic. It avoids the emotional volatility common in consumer brands and the theatrical reassurance often found in security marketing.

#### 1. Calm

Language remains steady and unfussy. Sentences are short, factual, and free from rhetorical performance. No urgency unless legally required.

#### 2. Neutral

No humour, cuteness, cheerfulness, hype, or conversational flair. The tone is informational, not personality-driven.

#### 3. Quietly confident

The brand is authoritative without being forceful. It states facts plainly and avoids both bravado and apology. Confidence comes from clarity, not volume.

#### 4. Factual

Uses concrete nouns and direct verbs. Avoids hyperbolic descriptors. No unnecessary adjectives. No metaphors implying magic, journeys, transformation, or heroics.

#### 5. Helpful, not friendly

The brand assists the user without trying to entertain them. It prioritises user focus and cognitive stability over rapport or warmth.

#### 6. Predictable

All communications sound like they come from the same place. There are no mood shifts, tonal deviations, or stylistic surprises.

#### 7. Non-manipulative

No fear-based framing. No emotional appeals. Compliance is serious; the brand must be stabilising, not pressurising.

---

## 2.2 Tone of Voice

Transcrypt’s tone of voice is the verbal expression of its architecture. It must be as calm, predictable, and structured as the platform itself. Tone is not used to create personality or emotional colour; its purpose is to reduce cognitive load, avoid ambiguity, and reinforce trust. The voice used across all written communication — product UI, website, documentation, marketing assets, support responses, and exported reports — must follow the same rules with no exceptions. Tone is therefore a system boundary, not a stylistic option.

### 2.2.1 Writing Style

Transcrypt’s writing style is grounded in clarity, restraint, and factual precision. It supports compliance work by eliminating unnecessary mental effort and by presenting information in a neutral, direct manner.

#### 1. Clear

Sentences are short, direct, and free of decorative language. Concrete nouns and direct verbs are preferred. Meaning must be explicit at first reading.

#### 2. Calm

The tone does not express excitement, urgency, apology, or emotional colour. No exclamation marks are used. No stylistic devices imply speed, drama, or pressure.

#### 3. Factual

Copy states what is required, what is happening, or what the user must do next. It avoids speculation, persuasion, and unfounded claims.

#### 4. Neutral

There is no humour, playfulness, or conversational friendliness. The writing does not mimic personality. It simply communicates information.

#### 5. Sparse

Adjectives are used only when necessary for meaning. There are no rhetorical flourishes, circular explanations, or narrative introductions. Brevity is a functional requirement.

#### 6. Instructional

Actions use clear imperatives: “Add device”, “Upload evidence”, “Review answers”. Conversational patterns such as “Let’s do this” or “Ready to continue?” are prohibited.

#### 7. Consistent

The same tone is used across all mediums. Marketing pages, blog posts, UI strings, and documentation must read as if written by a single steady system.

#### 8. Non-emotive

Copy must not express sympathy, encouragement, disappointment, enthusiasm, or reassurance. Compliance work requires cognitive stability, not emotional signalling.

#### 9. Deterministic

Language patterns remain stable over time. There are no mood shifts, stylistic experiments, or contextual tone changes. Writing must reflect the deterministic nature of the system.

### 2.2.2 Language Restrictions

Language restrictions prevent drift, inconsistency, and accidental introduction of emotion or hype. Any content that violates these rules is considered off-brand.

#### 1. No emotional or expressive language

Avoid words suggesting excitement, delight, frustration, or friendliness.
Examples of prohibited language: “excited”, “delighted”, “happy to help”, “don’t worry”.

#### 2. No hype or marketing superlatives

Prohibited: “cutting-edge”, “transformative”, “revolutionary”, “industry-leading”, “state-of-the-art”.
If a claim cannot be demonstrated through evidence, it is not permitted.

#### 3. No metaphors or figurative imagery

Avoid metaphors about journeys, magic, unlocking, levelling up, heroics, or guidance companions.
The brand communicates literally, not symbolically.

#### 4. No conversational devices

Prohibited: rhetorical questions, casual phrasing, emojis, slang, idioms, chatty statements, regionalisms, and informal contractions that add friendliness.

#### 5. No artificial intensity

Words suggesting urgency, speed, or alarm are banned unless mandated by regulation.
Avoid: “immediately”, “urgent”, “critical”, “as soon as possible”.

#### 6. No first-person subjectivity

Avoid: “we believe”, “we think”, “in our view”.
The brand is a structured system, not a personal perspective.

#### 7. No apologies unless legally required

Avoid: “Sorry about that”.
Use neutral factual patterns: “This action failed. Try again.”

#### 8. No over-reassurance

Avoid: “You’re on track”, “Almost there”, “You’re all set”.
Compliance surfaces must remain objective and unemotional.

#### 9. No humour

Humour, puns, and playful phrasing are prohibited across all surfaces.

#### 10. No stylistic emphasis

Avoid ALL CAPS for emphasis, elongated punctuation, decorative formatting, or typographic novelty.

#### 11. Precise use of modal language

Avoid weak modality: “might”, “could”, “should”, unless describing regulatory ambiguity.
Prefer direct statements that reduce interpretation.

---

## 2.3 Naming and Linguistic Rules

Transcrypt’s naming system is part of its structural integrity. Every concept, feature, and action must use a single, literal, unambiguous name across the product, documentation, marketing, and all external surfaces. Naming is not a creative layer; it is an extension of the architecture. One concept must map to one term, and that term must remain stable. No synonyms, metaphors, or stylistic variants are permitted. Any name change is treated as a versioned event under §10.4.

### 2.3.1 Product Naming Rules

#### 1. Company name

The company name is always **Transcrypt**.
No camel-case, spacing, punctuation, invented capitalisation, or stylised variants.
The name is not abbreviated and not translated.

#### 2. Product and module names

Product and module names must be literal, descriptive, and concise.
They must not imply capabilities not defined in the PRD or contradict architectural truths in the SAIS.

Permitted pattern examples:

* Transcrypt Essentials
* Transcrypt Essentials Plus (tier descriptor only)

Not permitted: invented words, thematic naming, metaphorical pack names, or emotive language.

#### 3. Feature names

Features must use the clearest possible noun for the concept they represent.
Examples of canonical terms:

* Evidence
* Controls
* Tasks
* Reports
* Scope
* Devices
* Users
* Audit log

These terms must appear identically in UI, documentation, PDFs, and the marketing site.

Forbidden: synonyms such as “attachments”, “proof”, “files”, “entries”, “objects”, or “supporting documents” when referring to evidence.

#### 4. Action names

Actions use imperative form without conversational cushioning.
Examples:

* Add device
* Upload evidence
* Review answers
* Export report
* Delete entry

Not permitted:
“Let’s add your device”, “Go ahead and…”, “You’re ready to upload”.

#### 5. Internal system names

Terms such as tenant, environment names, pipelines, and internal identifiers may appear only in technical documentation (SAIS, developer notes).
They must never appear in user-facing or marketing content.

### 2.3.2 Terminology Consistency

#### 1. One term per concept

Each concept has exactly one name.
It is used everywhere without synonyms or contextual alternatives.

#### 2. Framework naming

External frameworks are written in their canonical forms:

* Cyber Essentials
* Cyber Essentials Plus
* NIS2
* UK GDPR
* IEC 62443

Never abbreviate Cyber Essentials as CE in user-facing content.
Never invent stylised forms (“NIS-2”, “GDPR UK”).

#### 3. Organisation vs tenant

“Organisation” is the public-facing term.
“Tenant” is technical and used only in architectural and engineering contexts.

#### 4. Status language

Statuses must be mutually exclusive, literal, and easily understood:

* Not started
* In progress
* Pending review
* Completed

Avoid vague or expressive terms such as “Active”, “Ongoing”, “Almost there”, or “Working on it”.

#### 5. Time language

Use precise time expressions (e.g., “within 2 minutes”, “7 days”).
Avoid vague expressions such as “soon”, “shortly”, or “in a while”.

#### 6. Regulatory wording

Terms that may imply legal guidance must be used with care and remain consistent.
Where ambiguity exists, use the regulator’s original phrasing.

#### 7. Environment names

Local, Dev, Staging, and Production are internal references only.
They may not appear in customer-facing copy or reports.

#### 8. Terminology changes are versioned

Any change to naming must be deliberate, justified, updated across all surfaces, and logged under §10.4 Versioning and Release Management.

#### 9. Deterministic vocabulary

Vocabulary must remain stable.
No contextual renaming, no tone-based variants, no creative rephrasing.
This ensures consistent comprehension and aligns with deterministic system behaviour.

---

## 2.4 Tagline and Messaging Framework

Transcrypt’s tagline and messaging framework defines the core verbal statements through which the brand expresses its purpose. These messages are not marketing slogans or emotional appeals; they are structured, literal, and system-aligned summaries of the PRD’s intent, the SAIS’s architectural guarantees, and the PDS’s behavioural constraints.
Every public surface — homepage, app chrome, PDFs, documentation, slides, social — must draw from this framework to ensure consistent, predictable, and untheatrical communication. Messaging may not embellish, dramatise, or reinterpret the product’s purpose. It must remain grounded, clear, and calm at all times.

### 2.4.1 Tagline System

#### 1. Primary tagline

A single, high-level line used in hero surfaces, introduction blocks, and top-level presentations. It must be literal, calm, and aligned with Transcrypt’s structural promise.

Examples of permitted forms:

* **Compliance, without the confusion.**
* **Clear. Measurable. Repeatable.**
* **A simple, structured path to compliance.**
* **Compliance you can prove.**

The primary tagline must avoid hype, metaphor, emotional tone, or exaggerated claims. It may not imply AI magic, dramatic transformation, superior speed, or any capability not defined in the PRD or SAIS.

#### 2. Secondary taglines

Short supporting lines used in feature sections, subpages, documentation headers, or deck subtitles. These reinforce the core promise but remain restrained and factual.

Examples:

* **Structured workflows for real organisations.**
* **Evidence handled safely and consistently.**
* **Clear tasks. Predictable progress.**
* **Designed for SMEs.**

Secondary taglines must not drift stylistically from the primary tone. They expand context but do not reinterpret the product.

#### 3. Tagline constraints

All taglines must:

* use plain language
* make no unverified claims
* avoid emotional colour
* avoid metaphor
* avoid theatrics or inspirational phrasing
* match the Messaging Pillars in §1
* remain stable across surfaces
* be version-controlled if changed

No tagline may suggest outcomes the product cannot guarantee.

### 2.4.2 Messaging Architecture

The messaging architecture defines the structured hierarchy that governs how Transcrypt communicates across all channels. It prevents drift, ensures clarity, and ties all public statements back to the same small set of permitted ideas.

#### 1. Core promise

The top-level message all communication must reinforce.
Permitted examples:

* **Transcrypt removes uncertainty from cybersecurity compliance.**
* **A clear, structured way to achieve compliance.**

This message must remain literal, neutral, and grounded in the PRD.

#### 2. Message pillars

Every substantive message must align directly with one of the following:

* Clarity over complexity
* Trust through structure
* Guided, not overwhelming
* Confidence, not guesswork
* Built for real organisations

These pillars act as the foundation of all long-form and short-form messaging.

#### 3. Explanatory messaging

Used in product pages, documentation intros, onboarding, and presentations.
Characteristics:

* short
* factual
* non-emotive
* describes behaviour, not aspiration

Examples:

* **Transcrypt shows what needs to be done and why it matters.**
* **Evidence is stored and handled consistently.**
* **Progress is always visible.**

#### 4. Micro-messaging

Used in UI, email notifications, PDF exports, and support templates.
Examples:

* **Report generated.**
* **Pending review.**
* **Task completed.**

Micro-messaging must remain strictly literal and free from personality or warmth.

#### 5. Forbidden messaging patterns

The following are prohibited on all surfaces:

* emotional appeals (“Don’t worry”, “You’ve got this”)
* hype language (“transformative”, “revolutionary”)
* fear-based messaging (“Your business is at risk!”)
* metaphors (“compliance journey”, “unlock your potential”)
* conversational tone (“Let’s get started”)
* vague claims (“industry-leading platform”)
* expressive or theatrical phrasing

All messaging must remain neutral and factual.

#### 6. Deterministic messaging rules

Messaging must be stable across contexts and time.
Permitted statements cannot be stylised, remixed, or rewritten based on channel or audience.
Copy must reflect the same steady voice everywhere, matching the deterministic posture of the product.

#### 7. Versioning

Changes to taglines, message pillars, or architectural messaging require:

* justification
* review against PRD, SAIS, and PDS
* system-wide updates
* inclusion in §10.4 Versioning and Release Management

---

# 3. Logo System

The logo system defines the *fixed, non-negotiable* visual core of Transcrypt.
Where typography, colour, and layout establish tone, the logo system establishes identity: the symbolic anchor that carries the ideas of **sealed tenancy**, **containment**, and **deterministic structure** wherever the platform appears.

This is not a creative playground and not a family of “fun alternates.”
It is a governed asset: one primary mark, a tightly constrained set of secondary forms, and explicit rules for when each may be used. Every logo file in this section exists to prevent improvisation and to ensure that the brand expresses the same structural logic as the product and the architecture behind it.

The Transcrypt monogram is built on symmetry, figure–ground clarity, and controlled negative space. Its geometry reflects the platform’s engineering principles:

* **Symmetry** mirrors determinism, repeatability, and predictable outcomes.
* **Vertical forms** reflect the audit spine: the unbroken path from requirement to verification.
* **The enclosing arc** represents blast-radius containment and secure tenancy boundaries.
* **Negative space** carries as much meaning as the filled forms, echoing the platform’s emphasis on visibility, absence of drift, and unambiguous separation.

The rules that follow specify:

* the **primary logo** and its approved orientations,
* the **secondary and compact marks**,
* the precise **clearspace and minimum sizes**,
* the **restricted conditions** under which colour or orientation may change,
* and the explicit catalogue of **incorrect usages**.

Nothing outside these rules is permitted.
Nothing inside these rules may be altered, redrawn, recoloured, recombined, or “interpreted.”
This ensures that every appearance of Transcrypt — in UI, documentation, marketing, partner materials, or third-party environments — reflects the same engineered consistency as the platform itself.

---

## 3.1 Primary Logo

The primary logo is the authoritative expression of the Transcrypt identity. It consists of the monogram symbol — a precise geometric form built on symmetry, negative space, and controlled counter-shapes — paired with the Transcrypt wordmark in a fixed relationship. All other marks derive from this master asset and may not alter its proportions, geometry, or internal spacing.

The monogram embodies the engineering principles that underpin the platform: determinism, separation, and sealed tenancy. Its mirrored vertical structures reflect repeatability and internal order; the outer curvature conveys containment and controlled blast-radius boundaries; the negative space resolves into implicit letterforms only when the geometry is intact. Any distortion, recolouring, rotation, or reinterpretation breaks the mark’s logic and is not permitted.

The primary logo is used for all high-visibility brand surfaces, including the marketing site, product entry points, documentation covers, partnership decks, and any environment where Transcrypt must be unmistakably identified. It is also the reference asset from which secondary and compact variants inherit scale, spacing, stroke behaviour, and contrast conditions.

Only the approved files provided in the brand asset library may be used. Manual redrawing, recombination, or typesetting around the symbol is prohibited. The following subsections define its approved colour variants and the only valid orientations and lockups.

---

### 3.1.1 Colour Variants

Colour variations exist to maintain clarity, contrast, and structural integrity of the monogram under different lighting conditions and background surfaces. They are not stylistic options. Each variant is a functional state of the same symbol, governed by strict rules to preserve the geometry, figure–ground balance, and recognisability of the mark.

#### **Primary Black**

The default form of the logo is solid black. This variant preserves the maximum fidelity of the monogram’s counter-shapes and delivers the strongest figure–ground separation. It is the standard for all marketing, product, and documentation surfaces where a light or neutral background is used.

#### **Primary White (Inverse)**

The inverse white variant is used on dark or saturated brand backgrounds. It does not introduce alternate strokes or outlines; the geometry remains identical to the black version, simply expressed in reverse polarity. This variant exists solely to maintain accessibility and contrast compliance.

#### **Single-Colour Accent Variant**

A single-colour accent version may be used in controlled environments where colour harmonisation is required inside the product UI. This variant uses exactly one approved brand colour and must pass the same contrast criteria as the primary black and white forms. It cannot be used for marketing, external collateral, or any context where the logo functions as a primary identifier.

#### **Restrictions**

These constraints apply to every colour state without exception:

* No gradients, textures, transparencies, shadows, glows, or stroke effects.
* No multicolour combinations or experimental palettes.
* No low-contrast applications on photography, patterned surfaces, or tinted overlays unless the logo is placed inside an approved solid container.
* No recolouring by third parties; only the defined variants may be used.

The logo is a structural glyph, not a decorative graphic. Its colour states exist to defend clarity and recognisability, not to express mood or style.

---

### 3.1.2 Orientation and Lockups

The primary logo has a single correct orientation and a strictly limited set of approved lockups. These constraints protect the structural logic of the monogram — its symmetry, counter-form balance, and implied letterforms — and ensure that the logo behaves predictably across every surface.

#### **Upright Orientation**

The monogram exists in one orientation only: upright, with verticals aligned to the Cartesian grid. Rotating, skewing, or mirroring the form disrupts the negative-space relationships and breaks the implicit T/C reading.
The logo must never be angled, tilted, or placed on a sloped baseline.

#### **Horizontal Lockup**

The horizontal lockup pairs the monogram on the left with the Transcrypt wordmark on the right. It is the default arrangement for marketing surfaces, web headers, product entry points, documentation covers, and any environment where clear linear reading is required.
Spacing between the monogram and the wordmark is fixed and defined by the clearspace system in § 3.3; it may not be altered or visually “nudged.”

#### **Vertical Lockup**

The vertical lockup centres the monogram above the wordmark. This arrangement is used in tall or square formats: onboarding screens, splash pages, posters, social media tiles, and compressed layout blocks where the horizontal lockup loses presence.
The vertical lockup maintains the same proportional relationship between symbol and wordmark as the horizontal version and must be used exactly as supplied.

#### **Restrictions**

These rules apply to all lockups:

* No custom arrangements, re-stacking, or intermediary configurations.
* No placing the wordmark above the monogram, or beside it on the right.
* No surrounding text, taglines, or descriptors unless using an approved lockup containing them.
* No changes to the spacing, scale ratio, or alignment relationship between symbol and wordmark.
* No third-party “optimised” or redrawn lockups; the distributed assets are the only valid versions.

The lockup system is deliberately minimal and deterministic. It ensures that the logo maintains the same structural logic wherever it appears — whether in tight UI environments or full-width marketing layouts.

---

## 3.2 Secondary and Compact Logos

Secondary and compact logos are functional reductions of the Transcrypt monogram. They exist to maintain brand continuity in environments where the full primary lockup either does not fit or would compromise clarity. These forms are not alternatives, stylistic variations, or interpretive marks. They are context-specific expressions of the same geometry that defines the primary symbol.

The secondary mark uses the monogram alone. Compact marks apply this same geometry at extreme scales or inside constrained shapes, with only the minimum stroke or pixel compensation required for legibility. No other simplification or reinterpretation is permitted. Every variant inherits directly from `tc.svg` and must preserve the monogram’s symmetry, counterform logic, and negative-space balance.

---

### **3.2.1 Use Cases**

Secondary and compact marks serve environments where clarity, scale, or system integration demands a symbol-only representation of Transcrypt. Each use case is strictly defined.

#### **Application Shell and Navigation**

Inside the Essentials app and future modules, the monogram functions as the anchor for the product’s interface:

* Top-left app shell logo at 24–32px.
* Collapsed sidebar mode, where only icons are visible.
* Navigation drawers, mobile headers, and compact UI states.

The symbol provides a stable point of orientation without overwhelming functional UI.

#### **Small-Scale and Micro-Scale Icons**

At very small sizes — favicons, pinned shortcuts, toolbar icons — a compact version of the monogram is used. This variant retains the exact silhouette of the monogram with stroke or pixel-fitting adjustments only where required for raster clarity.

Examples include:

* Browser tabs (16px / 32px).
* OS-level pinned or shortcut icons.
* Compact in-product status markers or badges.

The geometry remains the same; only technical compensations differ.

#### **Technical Documentation and Diagrams**

The symbol is used as a structural anchor in diagrams and schematics in the SAIS, PDS, and operational documentation:

* Identification of Transcrypt’s trust boundary.
* Label for orchestrators, policy engines, or tenant isolation components.
* Visual reinforcement of “Transcrypt realm” within architectural compositions.

Its purpose is to signal system ownership, not to act as decoration.

#### **Identity Touchpoints and Avatars**

In contexts where brand representation must be compact — social profiles, internal communications platforms, partner dashboards — the monogram may be placed within an approved square or circular container.

Use cases include:

* LinkedIn or GitHub organisation avatars.
* Slack, Teams, or Discord workspace icons.
* Identity thumbnails in partner systems.

These avatars are not marketing assets; they are only for identity presence.

---

### **3.2.2 Restrictions**

Secondary and compact marks are tightly controlled to prevent fragmentation, reinterpretation, or brand drift.

#### **No Alternate Symbols**

There are no micro-logos, shortforms, cropped arcs, isolated stems, or simplified shapes.
The monogram is the monogram.
Every secondary or compact form must derive directly from its geometry.

#### **No Replacement of the Primary Logo**

Secondary or compact marks cannot be used:

* On marketing site heroes or headers.
* On external proposals or executive decks.
* On product launch surfaces or public-facing documentation covers.
* In any environment where Transcrypt must be introduced, not merely recognised.

The primary lockup is used for brand introduction.
The monogram-only mark is used for brand continuity.

#### **No Unapproved Containers or Shapes**

The monogram may not be placed inside arbitrary shapes such as capsules, rounded rectangles, hexagons, or decorative frames.
Only the approved square or circular containers for avatars and app icons are permitted.

#### **No Colour Deviation**

Secondary and compact marks follow the same colour rules as § 3.1.1:

* Black, white, or the single approved accent.
* No gradients, shadows, glows, or overlays.
* No recolouring by partners, vendors, or customer systems.

#### **No Alteration of Ratios or Stroke Geometry**

Except for the minimal stroke adjustments defined for micro-scale clarity:

* No thickening or thinning of strokes.
* No widening or compressing of the symbol.
* No rounding, softening, or redrawing of corners.
* No substituting geometric primitives.

The symbol’s proportions are invariant.
Pixel-fitting is a technical adjustment, not a design reinterpretation.

---

## 3.3 Clearspace and Minimum Size

Clearspace and minimum size rules exist to protect the structural logic of the Transcrypt monogram. Because the mark relies on symmetry, negative space, and tight internal ratios, it cannot survive crowding, compression, or overly small deployments without losing its implicit T/C reading and its sense of sealed containment. These rules define the minimum conditions under which the logo remains legible, recognisable, and consistent across all surfaces.

Clearspace protects the integrity of the mark in layout systems. Minimum sizes protect it in scale systems. Together, they ensure the logo maintains its engineered clarity whether used in marketing surfaces, product interfaces, or micro-scale iconography.

---

### **3.3.1 Clearspace Rules**

Clearspace acts as the “safety buffer” around the monogram and the primary lockup. It prevents surrounding elements from interfering with the counterforms that make the mark work. Because the monogram is defined by its internal void and its mirrored verticals, proximity to text, UI elements, or graphic noise can distort its reading and visually collapse the negative space.

#### **Defining the Clearspace Unit**

The clearspace unit is derived from the monogram’s own geometry to keep the rule proportional, not arbitrary.

**X = the width of one vertical stem of the monogram.**
This is a stable internal dimension that scales cleanly across all variants and ensures the protective zone feels balanced at any size.

#### **Primary Lockup Clearspace**

The primary logo (monogram + wordmark) requires clearspace of:

* **1X** on all sides for standard use.
* **2X** on hero surfaces, document covers, and marketing placements where breathing room reinforces authority and presence.

No external text, logos, UI elements, illustrations, or controls may enter the clearspace zone.
No optical adjustments are permitted; the clearspace is measured strictly from the bounding box.

#### **Secondary Mark Clearspace**

The symbol-only version uses the same clearspace unit:

* **1X** minimum clearspace on all sides.

When used in product UI (nav bars, drawers, sidebars), the clearspace may tighten slightly to **0.5X** if constrained by layout components, but only within the product interface — never in marketing or external collateral.

#### **Containered Icons**

Square or circular avatar icons inherit the same internal padding:

* The symbol must sit inside its container with **0.75X** internal padding to prevent edge crowding.

This prevents cramped avatars and preserves the silhouette even when cropped to small resolutions.

---

### **3.3.2 Minimum Size Specifications**

Minimum size requirements ensure that the monogram and lockups remain readable and structurally intact as they scale down. The goal is not merely “visible shape” but preservation of the counterform logic that gives the mark its character.

#### **Primary Lockup Minimum Sizes**

To maintain readability of both the monogram and the wordmark:

* **Digital minimum width:**
  **120px** for desktop, **96px** for mobile.
  Below this, the wordmark loses clarity and the monogram begins to crowd the spacing.

* **Print minimum width:**
  **35mm**.
  Anything smaller should use the symbol-only secondary mark.

#### **Secondary Monogram Minimum Sizes**

The monogram alone is more tolerant of small-scale use but still has a lower bound:

* **UI minimum:**
  **24px** for interface chrome, navigation anchors, and badge-level indicators.
  Below this, fine negative space collapses.

* **Documentation minimum:**
  **20px** when used as a diagram anchor or system label.

#### **Compact and Micro-Scale Icons**

For extremely small deployments, a technically compensated variant (`tc-favicon.svg`) is used to maintain silhouette recognition:

* **Favicon minimum:**
  **16px**, with pixel-fitting strokes.

* **Pinned / shortcut icons:**
  **32px** and above.

No other geometry changes are permitted. The favicon variant is a functional render, not a separate symbol.

---

## 3.4 Incorrect Usage Examples

Incorrect usage compromises the structural logic of the Transcrypt monogram and weakens its ability to function as a precise, engineered identifier. The monogram relies on specific internal ratios, consistent counterforms, and exact geometry. Any distortion, recolouring, or unauthorised manipulation breaks these relationships and creates a diluted or counterfeit version of the mark. The examples in this section define prohibited treatments so the logo remains uncompromised across all environments.

---

### **3.4.1 Distortion and Rotation**

Distortion of any kind destroys the monogram’s symmetry and the implicit T/C structure encoded in its negative space. Rotation breaks the vertical alignment that defines the mark and collapses its internal tension.

The following are strictly prohibited:

#### **Stretching or Squashing**

Changing the horizontal or vertical proportions alters stroke thickness, disrupts counterforms, and breaks the intended geometry.
The logo must never be compressed, expanded, squeezed, or stretched — even “slightly” for layout convenience.

#### **Rotation**

The monogram must remain upright at all times.
No rotation, angling, tilting, or diagonal placement is allowed.
Even small-degree rotations distort the vertical spine and disrupt the perception of structural containment.

#### **Skewing or Perspective Transformations**

Shearing, slanting, applying perspective, or simulating 3D depth destroys the axial symmetry and violates the deterministic engineering character of the mark.

#### **Cropping or Partial Display**

The monogram must never be cropped, cut off, or shown as a fragment (e.g., just the arc, just one stem).
This breaks the figure–ground relationships that give the mark meaning.

#### **Reconstruction or Redrawing**

No redrawing, re-spacing, approximations, “cleanups,” or designer reinterpretations.
The only valid geometry is the one provided in the official assets.

---

### **3.4.2 Colour Misuse**

The monogram’s clarity depends not only on geometry but also on correct colour contrast. Because the mark operates through negative space and silhouette, colour misuse quickly collapses its readability or causes the shape to visually merge with its surroundings.

The following treatments are prohibited:

#### **Non-Brand Colours**

The logo must not appear in arbitrary colours, gradients, tints, pastels, overlays, or promotional palettes.
Only pure black, pure white, or the approved single-colour accent are permitted.

#### **Low-Contrast Placement**

Using the monogram on backgrounds that do not provide sufficient contrast — such as mid-tone greys, busy textures, coloured photographs, or patterned surfaces — is not allowed unless placed within an approved solid container.

#### **Effects and Filters**

No shadows, glows, blurs, outer strokes, embossing, neon effects, or transparency.
These treatments introduce visual noise and undermine the symbol’s precision.

#### **Layering or Masking Experiments**

The logo must not be used as a mask for images, gradients, illustrations, or videos.
It is not a decorative frame or pattern; it is a controlled glyph.

#### **Unapproved Containers**

The monogram may not be placed inside arbitrary shapes (rounded rectangles, capsules, hexagons, abstract containers).
Only the sanctioned square or circular avatar containers are allowed.

# 4. Colour Palette

Colour in Transcrypt’s identity is not an expressive layer. It is a functional system that supports clarity, hierarchy, and reliability across every surface — from the marketing site to the Essentials app to PDF exports and architectural documentation. The palette exists to reinforce Transcrypt’s role as *boring, safe infrastructure*: predictable, legible, and free from aesthetic noise.
Numeric definitions for every colour in this system are held in Appendix A — Colour Tokens and Specifications, and must only be used via those tokens (never as raw hex values).

The product is built on determinism, sealed data boundaries, and unambiguous truth. The colour system mirrors that behaviour. It uses a restrained set of tones, chosen not for personality but for their ability to organise information and maintain consistency across light and dark environments.

The palette has three structural layers:

1. **Primary colours** — the deep engineered base, white/near-white surfaces, and a single cerulean accent that acts as the system’s point of focus.
2. **Secondary colours** — functional tones for semantic states, diagrams, and supporting UI, never competing with the primary accent.
3. **Neutral foundations** — a greyscale that provides depth, spacing, and hierarchy without drawing attention to itself.

These layers map directly to the implementation tokens in Appendix A: primary colours to §A.1 Primary Palette Tokens, secondary semantic colours to §A.2 Secondary Semantic Tokens, and neutral foundations to §A.3 Neutral Greyscale Tokens.

Colour is applied sparingly, with strict contrast rules, minimal decorative usage, and a bias toward monochrome forms wherever clarity would benefit. The logo’s silhouette and the system’s typography remain the anchors; colour supports them, never leads.

This section defines the palette, its hierarchy, and the constraints governing its use, so Transcrypt’s identity remains stable, serious, and unmistakably technical — whatever surface it appears on. All examples and rules in this section are normative only when expressed through the tokens defined in Appendix A; any colour that is not represented there is considered out of system.

---

## 4.1 Primary Brand Palette

The primary palette defines the core colours that carry Transcrypt’s identity across all surfaces. These colours set the tonal temperature of the brand: cold, precise, and deliberately restrained. They form the visual spine from which every other colour decision derives. In implementation, the primary palette is realised through the A.1 Primary Palette Tokens (e.g. --brand-base-900, --brand-surface-0, --accent-500), which form the non-negotiable set of brand colours.

Transcrypt uses a minimal primary set: a deep engineered base, clean light surfaces for clarity, and a single cerulean accent that acts as the system’s point of focus. Each colour has a clearly defined role. The base establishes authority and stability; the light surfaces handle legibility and layout structure; the accent provides directional emphasis without introducing emotion or stylistic noise.

The primary palette is intentionally narrow. It ensures that the brand remains consistent whether rendered in UI chrome, PDF exports, diagrams, or physical materials. Everything outside these core colours is secondary, functional, or prohibited.

---

### 4.1.1 Core Colours

The core colours define the minimal set of tones that represent Transcrypt in every context where the brand must be unmistakable. Each colour has a defined, non-negotiable purpose. Nothing outside this set carries brand identity. In practice, this means that only tokens in §A.1 may be used to represent the Transcrypt brand; secondary, neutral, or filigree tokens are always subordinate and may not substitute for these cores.

#### **Engineered Base**

A deep, near-black blue forms the base of the identity. It is implemented through the tokens defined in §A.1.1 Engineered Base (for example --brand-base-900 and --brand-base-800).
It is the backdrop for hero surfaces, product chrome, and structural components where authority and clarity matter.
This tone anchors the entire system and ensures that the brand reads as a stable piece of infrastructure rather than a decorative interface.

The engineered base is never used as an accent, never softened, and never tinted. Its job is to hold the frame.

#### **Light Surfaces**

White and near-white surfaces provide the clarity layer of the brand. These map to the tokens in §A.1.2 Light Surfaces (--brand-surface-0, --brand-surface-50, --brand-surface-100), which must be used for all content-bearing light backgrounds.
These values control content-heavy environments — documentation, data tables, PDF exports, dashboards, and any space where reading comfort outranks atmosphere.

They exist purely for legibility and spatial structure.
They do not function as accents and they do not attempt to carry emotion.

#### **Cerulean Accent**

The single point of colour in the primary palette is a controlled cerulean — a mid-spectrum blue chosen for its engineered neutrality. In the token set this is represented by §A.1.3 Cerulean Accent (--accent-500 as the primary value, with --accent-300 and --accent-700 as its only permitted variants).
It carries no emotional overtones and does not behave like a marketing highlight.
Its purpose is functional:

* to draw attention to interactive elements,
* to denote focus or state transitions,
* to mark calls to action,
* to guide the user in complex flows.

The accent always works in a trio: base, light surface, cerulean.
It is never paired with additional accents and never used as a background.
Its variants (soft, deep) support accessibility and hierarchy but remain within the same hue family.

#### **Black and White Extremes**

Pure black and pure white are retained as functional extremes for typography, diagrams, and high-contrast environments.
They are not brand colours but operational tools, ensuring that text, icons, and schematics remain razor-clear across all surfaces. These are implemented as the tokens defined in §A.1.4 Black/White Extremes (--black, --white) and must not be aliased or redefined elsewhere.

---

### 4.1.2 Palette Meaning and Associations

The colours in Transcrypt’s primary palette are chosen for their behavioural qualities, not their aesthetic personality. Each tone carries a specific operational meaning that aligns with the product’s purpose: clarity, stability, and predictable behaviour in environments where ambiguity creates risk.

#### **Engineered Base — Stability and Containment**

The deep engineered base represents structural integrity.
It echoes the sealed nature of Transcrypt’s tenants and the immutability of stored evidence.
It is the visual metaphor for “the boundary”: the line between what is inside the system and what is not.
This colour signals seriousness, focus, and the absence of ornamentation.
It does not attempt to evoke emotion — it suppresses it.

#### **Light Surfaces — Clarity and Inspection**

White and near-white surfaces represent inspection, legibility, and audit-friendly visibility.
They reflect the product’s core mission: making truth easier to see.
These colours support reading, comparison, annotation, and long-form documentation without fatigue.
They are not expressive; they are deliberately neutral, creating an environment where content, not colour, carries meaning.

#### **Cerulean Accent — Direction and Intent**

Cerulean serves as a single point of controlled emphasis.
It directs the eye without shouting, allowing the system to guide attention in a calm, engineered way.
It is used where the user’s next step needs to be clear: calls to action, selected states, interactive surfaces, progress indicators.
Cerulean is chosen for its neutrality — cooler than consumer blue, warmer than instrument cyan — a technical midpoint that conveys “this is the thing to pay attention to” without signalling urgency, emotion, or brand personality.

This accent is not decorative.
Its meaning is consistent wherever it appears: **focus here**.

#### **Black and White Extremes — Precision and Truth**

Pure black and pure white are functional extremes used for typography, diagrams, and schematic elements where precision matters more than mood.
They represent binary clarity: on/off, true/false, present/absent.
In documentation and technical materials, these colours reinforce the determinism at the heart of the product.

---

## 4.2 Secondary Palette

The secondary palette supports the product’s functional needs without ever competing with the primary colours. These tones are not part of Transcrypt’s identity; they are part of its interface logic. Their job is to communicate state, hierarchy, and system meaning in environments where monochrome alone is insufficient. All secondary colours are bound to the semantic token set in §A.2 Secondary Semantic Tokens (success, warning, and error); no additional state colours may be introduced outside that appendix.

Secondary colours exist only to improve comprehension. They never introduce personality, and they never dilute the authority of the primary palette.

---

### **4.2.1 Supporting Colours**

The supporting colours are a tightly constrained set of functional tones used for semantics, data visualisation, and system feedback. They follow three principles:

1. **Functional, not expressive** — every tone corresponds to a precise meaning.
2. **Subordinate to the accent** — nothing in this set may resemble or compete with cerulean.
3. **Neutral until required** — these colours appear only when they serve a clear informational purpose.

Concretely, success, warning, and error states are implemented using the --success-*, --warn-*, and --err-* token groups defined in §A.2.1–A.2.3. UI elements must reference these tokens directly rather than introducing new hex values or ad hoc shades.

The typical categories include:

#### **Success / Confirmation**

A muted green family used only to communicate “this state is valid, complete, or healthy.”
Greens are subdued and never bright. They reinforce correctness without introducing exuberance or emotional positivity.

#### **Warning / Caution**

An amber family used to signal conditions that require attention but do not represent failure.
These tones echo industrial caution systems — neither playful nor alarming, simply informative.

#### **Error / Failure**

A disciplined, desaturated red used exclusively for errors, failed checks, invalid evidence, or blocked actions.
No gradient, no glow, no emotional theatrics — just clear, immediate signalling.

#### **Diagrammatic Neutrals**

A narrow set of greys or muted blues used in architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and PDS/SAIS illustrations. These are drawn from the neutral ladder in §A.3 Neutral Greyscale Tokens (e.g. --neutral-300 to --neutral-900) and may not introduce new hues.
Their purpose is structural clarity, not identity.

These tones sit behind the brand; they never define it.

---

### **4.2.2 Use Cases**

Supporting colours appear only in contexts where the user needs clear, fast interpretation of system state, or where data representation requires additional visual channels.

#### **Semantic States in the Essentials App**

Each supporting colour maps to a single semantic domain:

* Success → evidence complete, evaluation ready
* Warning → expiring exceptions, incomplete prompts, upcoming deadlines
* Error → blocked runs, invalid evidence, permission issues

These mappings are fixed and universal.
A colour may not be reinterpreted.

#### **System Feedback and Notifications**

Secondary colours are used sparingly in:

* alerts
* banners
* inline validation messages
* status chips
* logs and change history markers

The hierarchy is always:
**base → light → accent → secondary (only for state).**

#### **Data Visualisation and Diagrams**

Charts, progress meters, and SAIS/PDS diagrams may use supporting colours only when needed for differentiation:

* categories in bar charts
* thresholds in compliance readiness
* steps in evaluation pipelines
* architectural boundaries

No chart may use the primary accent unless it represents action or focus.
The accent’s role remains protected.

#### **Documentation and Exports**

In PDFs, reports, and printed material, secondary colours remain muted to ensure:

* legible contrast
* high reproduction accuracy
* compatibility with grayscale printing
* no drift into marketing-style colour storytelling

Export and print implementations must use the specialised tokens in §A.4 Print and Export Safe Tokens (for example --export-accent-safe, --export-text-primary) to guarantee consistent reproduction.

Supporting colours never appear as backgrounds or large surfaces.

---

## 4.3 Neutral Foundations

Neutral tones form the structural backbone of Transcrypt’s colour system. They are not expressive, decorative, or thematic — they exist purely to create hierarchy, depth, and separation across light and dark environments. Neutrals ensure that information carries the visual weight, not colour. All neutral values used across the product map directly to the tokens defined in **§A.3 Neutral Greyscale Tokens**, and no additional greys, “almost-greys”, or improvised desaturated colours may be introduced.

Neutrals are used to define spacing, boundaries, dividers, and text hierarchy. They allow the engineered base, light surfaces, and cerulean accent to remain stable and unambiguous, while providing the subtle gradations required for complex interface layouts. They are functional tools — not part of the brand’s identity.

Transcrypt’s greyscale is intentionally narrow. The steps from --neutral-900 through --neutral-50 describe a controlled ladder that works consistently across UI chrome, documentation, diagrams, and exported PDFs. Designers and engineers must reference these values directly; any divergence breaks the determinism expected of the system.

---

## **4.3.1 Greyscale System**

The greyscale system provides ten deliberate steps:
**--neutral-900 → --neutral-50**, as defined precisely in **§A.3 Neutral Greyscale Tokens**.

Each step has a single responsibility:

* **--neutral-900 / -800**
  High-authority text on light surfaces; diagram outlines; headings in documentation; structural anchors.
  These are never used on dark panels.

* **--neutral-700 / -600**
  Secondary headings, labels, and body text on darker backgrounds; metadata in the product UI; hierarchy in complex layouts.

* **--neutral-500 / -400**
  Muted text, tertiary annotations, form helper text, non-critical meta. These tones must never be elevated to primary text roles.

* **--neutral-300 / -200**
  Borders, separators, table rules, visual scaffolding in both UI and diagrams.
  These define structure, not emphasis.

* **--neutral-100 / -50**
  Lightest backgrounds for cards, panels, and lifted surfaces.
  These values establish elevation and layering without introducing colour.

No neutral tone may be repurposed as an accent, a semantic colour, or a marketing element. The neutrals are the quiet layer beneath the system’s functional and identity colours.

---

## **4.3.2 Background Layering Rules**

Backgrounds follow a deterministic layering model that mirrors the architectural principles defined in the PRD and SAIS: clear boundaries, predictable behaviour, and no visual ambiguity. All layering must be constructed exclusively from **A.1 light surfaces**, **A.1 engineered base values**, and **A.3 neutral tokens**.

The rules are:

**1. Dark-first hierarchy**
Dark panels use the engineered base tokens (--brand-base-900, --brand-base-800) as foundational layers. Lighter neutrals appear only as separators or text, never as backgrounds over the base.

**2. Light-first hierarchy**
In documentation, reports, and long-form reading environments, light surfaces (--brand-surface-0, -50, -100) establish the canvas. Neutrals provide the hierarchy above it.

**3. Elevation by brightness, never by hue**
Elevation is expressed by moving **one to two steps** up or down the neutral ladder, not by adding colours or tinted variants.

**4. No chromatic layering**
Accents (--accent-500/300/700) may never be used as backgrounds or layer fills. They are reserved for interactive emphasis only.

**5. Print and export alignment**
Where surfaces must appear in exported or printed documents, the system substitutes the specialised print-safe tokens from **§A.4**. Neutral and light surface values must map directly to their print equivalents. No on-screen-only values may leak into exported artefacts.

**6. Diagram constraints**
Architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and PDS/SAIS figures must use only **A.3 neutrals** (and the occasional cerulean accent) to ensure clarity and reproducibility across light and dark surfaces.

**7. No substitution**
If a designer or engineer requires a shade that does not exist in **A.3**, the correct response is to adjust the design, not to invent a new neutral.

---

## 4.4 Use Across Light and Dark Surfaces

Transcrypt’s colour system must behave consistently across both light and dark environments. The identity is not allowed to vary in personality or tone depending on theme; the palette is engineered so that meaning, hierarchy, and affordances remain stable regardless of background.

All surfaces — whether rendered in the marketing site, the Essentials app, documentation, or PDFs — must adhere strictly to the implementation tokens in **§A.1 Primary Palette Tokens**, **§A.2 Secondary Semantic Tokens**, and **§A.3 Neutral Greyscale Tokens**. No colour may appear in one environment that is not represented as a token in Appendix A.

The behaviour is deterministic:
**light surfaces establish clarity; the engineered base establishes authority; the accent provides focus; neutrals create hierarchy; semantics communicate state.**
Nothing else is permitted.

---

## **4.4.1 Light Surface Rules**

Light environments use the suite of surface tokens defined in **§A.1.2 Light Surfaces**. Their purpose is to create the clean, audit-friendly reading environment that underpins Transcrypt’s product behaviour.

The rules are:

**1. Light surfaces are the default canvas.**
All content-heavy areas — documentation, tables, PDFs, export views, long-form explanations, system settings — must use the light surface tokens (`--brand-surface-0`, `--brand-surface-50`, `--brand-surface-100`) as their backgrounds.

**2. Text hierarchy is neutral-driven.**
Over light surfaces, primary text must use `--neutral-900`.
Secondary text uses `--neutral-700` or `--neutral-600`.
Meta and helper text use `--neutral-500` or `--neutral-400`.

Accents are never used for text except in CTAs or selected states, where they map explicitly to `--accent-500` or `--accent-700`.

**3. No decorative colour blocks.**
Large panels or cards may not adopt accent or semantic colours as their backgrounds.
All content surfaces must remain within the light-surface tokens.

**4. Cerulean is for interaction only.**
In light environments, accent tokens must appear only on:

* primary and secondary actions (buttons),
* selected tab states,
* focus indications,
* progress indicators,
* navigational emphasis.

Cerulean (`--accent-500`, with soft and deep variants) must never be used to “colour” a section or to provide mood.

**5. Semantic colours stay small.**
Success/warning/error tokens (`--success-*`, `--warn-*`, `--err-*`) may appear only in:

* chips,
* inline validation,
* alerts,
* status indicators.

They may never control the overall background of a page or component.

**6. Print/export behaviour must follow §A.4.**
When a light-surface design is exported to PDF, the system must switch to print-safe equivalents such as `--export-text-primary` and `--export-accent-safe`.
No on-screen-only colour is permitted in exported artefacts.

---

## **4.4.2 Dark Surface Rules**

Dark environments use the engineered base tokens from **§A.1.1 Engineered Base**, supported by the neutral ladder from **§A.3**. Dark surfaces are not an alternative “theme”; they are the structural frame used in high-authority areas such as hero sections, chrome, and system-level panels.

The rules are:

**1. The engineered base is the only dark background.**
Dark backgrounds must always be either:

* `--brand-base-900` (deep),
* `--brand-base-800` (variant).

No invented dark tones, no off-brand blues, no grey-substitutes.

**2. Neutrals carry all text and structure.**
On dark backgrounds:

* Primary text uses `--white` or `--neutral-50`, depending on contrast.
* Secondary text uses `--neutral-300`.
* Tertiary or meta uses `--neutral-400` or `--neutral-500`.

Accents must be used sparingly on dark surfaces and only for the same functional roles as in light mode: CTA, state, focus, or direction.

**3. No light-surface tokens inside dark panels.**
Cards, containers, and insets rendered over a dark base must use neutrals (`--neutral-900` → `--neutral-100`) to define layering.
`--brand-surface-0` / `--brand-surface-50` may not be used directly inside dark chrome.

**4. Elevation depends on brightness, not colour.**
A panel elevated above `--brand-base-900` may move up the neutral ladder (`--neutral-800`, `--neutral-700`) but must never use accent or semantic tones to indicate depth.

**5. Cerulean must never become a background.**
In dark environments, cerulean appears brighter and therefore must remain strictly confined to functional roles.
`--accent-500` / `--accent-700` may not fill entire components, screens, panels, or cards.

**6. Semantic colours follow the same constraints.**
Success, warning, and error states remain small, controlled, and informational.
Their tokens (`--success-*`, `--warn-*`, `--err-*`) may only appear in chips, inline feedback, or alert overlays — never as structural backgrounds.

**7. Diagram usage is neutral-first.**
All diagrams rendered over dark backgrounds must use neutral tokens for nodes, lines, and boundaries, with cerulean permitted only for emphasis or flow direction.
No semantic colours may control large diagram shapes.

---

## 4.5 Prohibited Colour Applications

Transcrypt’s colour system is intentionally restrictive.
Its purpose is to eliminate ambiguity, remove visual noise, and prevent any drift toward expressive or marketing-styled design.
To maintain this stability, the following applications are explicitly prohibited.
These rules apply across the marketing site, the Essentials app, documentation, diagrams, and all exported artefacts.

Any colour usage outside the tokens defined in **Appendix A** is automatically considered out-of-system and non-compliant.

---

## **4.5.1 Accessibility Failures**

These prohibitions ensure the system remains legible, predictable, and WCAG-aligned.

**1. Insufficient contrast between text and background.**
Text must never be rendered using a token that does not meet contrast requirements against its surface token.
Examples of prohibited combinations:

* `--neutral-500` text on `--brand-surface-100`
* `--accent-300` text on `--brand-base-800`
* `--neutral-400` text over `--accent-300`

If contrast cannot be guaranteed, the element must revert to the permitted text tokens (`--neutral-900` on light; `--white` / `--neutral-50` on dark).

**2. Accent-coloured text for non-interactive copy.**
Cerulean tokens (`--accent-300`, `--accent-500`, `--accent-700`) may not be used as text colour except:

* primary CTA buttons,
* selected states,
* focus indicators,
* navigational emphasis.

All other text must use neutrals or extremes.

**3. Semantic colours used for body text.**
`--success-*`, `--warn-*`, and `--err-*` may not be used for paragraphs, labels, headers, or navigational elements.
They are reserved exclusively for status signalling.

**4. Ghosted text over semantic backgrounds.**
Any text placed on semantic colours must use approved semantic text tokens (e.g. `--success-text`) — never neutrals or generic white.

**5. Gradients that reduce readability.**
No gradient may be used as a text fill.
Accented gradient text is prohibited outside specific marketing headers and must have explicit approval in design QA (§11 of the PDS).

---

## **4.5.2 Situations to Avoid**

These prohibitions maintain identity coherence, prevent token misuse, and protect Transcrypt’s neutral engineering tone.

**1. Accent colours as backgrounds.**
Cerulean tokens must never fill panels, sections, cards, page backgrounds, modal surfaces, table rows, or diagram regions.
Accent is for interaction, not decoration.

**2. Semantic colours as section or card backgrounds.**
Success/warning/error tokens may not be used to colour:

* hero banners,
* feature cards,
* entire rows in tables,
* documentation surfaces,
* app screens.

They may appear only in chips, inline validation elements, and alerts.

**3. Arbitrary blues outside the accent family.**
No shade of blue beyond the defined accent tokens (`--accent-300/500/700`) may appear anywhere in the system.
This prevents drift into “brandish” cool tones or diluted cerulean copies.

**4. Off-system greys.**
Only tokens in **§A.3 Neutral Greyscale Tokens** may be used.
Hex values such as `#e0e0e0`, `#2a2a2a`, or any designer-invented grey are prohibited.

**5. Colour-coded user roles or multi-accent systems.**
No feature or flow may introduce:

* multiple accent colours,
* per-user colour themes,
* colour-driven persona indicators.

This prevents brand fragmentation and keeps hierarchy stable.

**6. Decorative colour for mood-setting.**
Transcrypt does not use colour to evoke emotion, energy, or personality.
Prohibited examples:

* warm gradients for “friendly onboarding”,
* purple or green highlight bars in marketing copy,
* colourful badges or ribbons.

If mood must be conveyed, it must be done through structure, typography, and clarity — never colour.

**7. Token aliasing.**
No component may redefine a token (e.g., `--accent-500: #2769f0;`).
All overrides and reassignments are prohibited.
Tokens defined in Appendix A are the single source of truth.

**8. Colour used to encode meaning twice.**
For example: a semantic colour plus an icon plus a border.
The rule is: **one semantic channel at a time.**
If a semantic colour is present, additional colour-based reinforcement is prohibited.

**9. Dark-mode variants that change hue.**
Dark environments may not substitute alternate hues “for visibility.”
Only neutral brightness adjustments are permitted; the hue must remain identical to its token.

**10. Print/export introducing new colours.**
PDFs may not introduce non-token colours “for clarity” or “for print optimisation.”
All printable colours must come from **§A.4 Print and Export Safe Tokens**.

---

# 5. Typography

Typography in Transcrypt is not decoration. It is the structural backbone that carries information with precision, predictability, and zero ambiguity. The type system exists to make content readable under inspection, reliable under load, and consistent across every surface — from the marketing site to the Essentials app to PDF exports, architectural diagrams, and logged evidence trails.

Where colour provides hierarchy, typography provides cadence: a controlled, measured rhythm that keeps the interface calm even when the content is dense. The system avoids stylistic flourish, avoids expressive forms, and avoids any hint of brand “voice.” Type is the final carrier of seriousness in a platform built around sealed boundaries, immutable artefacts, and deterministic behaviour.

Transcrypt uses a single, unified typographic family across all platforms. This eliminates drift, prevents mismatched personalities, and reinforces the core brand principle: boring, safe infrastructure. The chosen family must perform equally well in UI chrome, technical writing, diagrams, and formal exports, with clear weight separation and disciplined spacing behaviour.

All font usage in this section is normative and must be implemented exactly as specified. The underlying font tokens and fallback stacks defined here govern both product and marketing surfaces; no alternative typefaces may be introduced without revising this section.

## 5.1 Brand Typefaces

Typography in Transcrypt uses a single, unified type family with a monospaced companion. This pair covers every context the platform must support: dense UI, long-form documentation, formal PDF exports, architectural diagrams, and code-adjacent content. The goal is total consistency — a single typographic DNA across all surfaces, with no room for substitutions or accidental drift.

The typefaces chosen for Transcrypt must be stable, neutral, technically minded, and available across platforms without licensing friction. They must prioritise legibility under load, predictable metrics, and reliable rendering on macOS, Windows, Linux, and mobile environments.

All primary and secondary type usage maps directly to the stacks defined in §5.3.1 Font Loading and Fallbacks. No other font families may be introduced.

---

### 5.1.1 Primary Typeface

**IBM Plex Sans** is the primary typeface of Transcrypt.

It is used for:

* all UI text (navigation, labels, buttons, chips)
* all long-form content (marketing, documentation, help guides)
* all product surfaces (forms, tables, evaluation flows)
* all exports (PDFs, evidence bundles, reports)
* all headings, sub-headings, and body text

IBM Plex Sans is chosen because:

* it is engineered, not expressive — a precise, modern grotesk
* it has excellent weight separation without theatrical contrast
* it holds clarity at small sizes, particularly in data-dense UI
* it renders predictably on all major OSes
* its neutral character aligns with Transcrypt’s identity:
  **boring, safe, infrastructure-grade**

IBM Plex Sans is the only font permitted for brand-carrying text.
All headings, labels, buttons, and structural text must use it.

Weight usage is defined later in §5.3.2 Weight and Style Usage.

---

### 5.1.2 Secondary and Accent Typefaces

**IBM Plex Mono** is the secondary and accent typeface of Transcrypt.

It is used exclusively where precision, alignment, and technical clarity matter:

* code snippets and inline technical notation
* identifiers (tenant IDs, rulepack IDs, evaluation run IDs)
* timestamps and fixed-width tokens
* tables containing numerical or structured data
* diagrams and schematics requiring fixed alignment
* UI elements where even spacing is essential (e.g., audit logs)

IBM Plex Mono brings:

* predictable glyph width for alignment in tables, logs, and exports
* visual distinction without introducing stylistic noise
* engineering temperament, matching the platform’s deterministic behaviour

IBM Plex Mono must **never** be used for general body text, headings, or marketing-facing content.
It serves a functional role only: precision, not personality.

The only two permitted families in the entire system are:

* **IBM Plex Sans**
* **IBM Plex Mono**

Everything else is fallback, not part of the identity.

---

## 5.2 Hierarchy and Roles

Typography in Transcrypt is a hierarchy of function, not decoration. Every typographic layer expresses a distinct behavioural role within the product: headings establish structure, body text carries substance, and meta text provides supporting signals without competing for attention. The hierarchy is engineered to be predictable across the marketing site, Essentials app, PDF exports, and architectural documentation.

All typographic roles must be implemented exclusively using IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono (see §5.1). Decisions about size, weight, and spacing are deterministic, not aesthetic. The purpose of this hierarchy is to eliminate ambiguity for the user, reduce cognitive effort, and ensure that every surface reflects the same internal logic.

---

### 5.2.1 Headings

Headings define structure. They communicate hierarchy, not emotion. Their job is to break information into navigable layers without introducing artistic voice.

All headings use **IBM Plex Sans** with controlled weight ranges:

* **H1**: strong structural anchor
* **H2**: major sectional break
* **H3**: intra-section heading
* **H4/H5**: small-scale technical headings for UI or documentation

The behavioural rules:

1. **H1** is reserved for the top of a page or major documentation sections.
   It must not be used inside cards, modals, or nested UI.

2. **H2** defines primary subsections.
   Marketing, documentation, and product surfaces must align on this usage.

3. **H3** structures content within a section.
   It is the default heading level inside the Essentials app.

4. **H4/H5** provide granularity for long-form documentation, SAIS diagrams, or PDS detail.
   They must not be used to mimic body text or meta info.

Weights are restricted:

* **H1–H3:** Medium (500) or Semibold (600)
* **H4/H5:** Regular (400) or Medium (500)

No heading may use:

* italics
* artificially condensed or expanded letterforms
* arbitrary weight jumps
* decorative colour (only primary palette rules apply)

Headings must always represent structure, never emphasis.
Emphasis is handled through content and layout, not typography.

---

### 5.2.2 Body and Meta Text

Body and meta text handle the actual informational load of the product: explanations, labels, long-form documentation, audits, evidence descriptions, and UI copy. Their purpose is clarity, low friction, and comfortable reading.

#### **Body Text**

Body text uses **IBM Plex Sans Regular (400)** by default.
Its characteristics:

* high legibility at small sizes
* clean rhythm for long-form reading
* no ornamental contrast
* predictable rendering in PDFs and exports

Body text variations:

* **Bold (600)** is reserved exclusively for semantic emphasis.
* **Medium (500)** may be used for short spans where clarity demands it (e.g., form field labels).
* **Italic** is prohibited across the entire system.

Body text must always appear on approved light or dark surfaces using the contrast rules defined in §4.4.

#### **Meta Text**

Meta text is informational scaffolding: timestamps, captions, hints, change logs, version tags, evaluation IDs, or secondary annotations. It communicates context, not content.

Rules:

* Uses **IBM Plex Sans Regular (400)** or **IBM Plex Sans Light (300)** depending on environment.
* Colour must always come from the neutral ladder (typically --neutral-500 to --neutral-300).
* Never competes with body or heading levels.
* May be slightly reduced in size, but never below accessibility thresholds.
* No bold, no accent colour, no decorative behaviour.

Meta text must always remain quiet.
Its job is to support the structure, not participate in it.

---

## 5.3 Web and Application Font Rules

The typography system only works if the implementation is stable. Transcrypt does not allow drift in font rendering, fallback behaviour, or weight usage. IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono must load predictably across all environments — the marketing site, the Essentials app, embedded components, and exported PDFs.

All font usage must be deterministic. Network conditions, browser differences, or OS defaults must not change typographic appearance. Any deviation is considered a defect in presentation, not a stylistic variation.

---

### 5.3.1 Font Loading and Fallbacks

Transcrypt uses **IBM Plex Sans** as the primary UI and documentation typeface, and **IBM Plex Mono** for code, rulepacks, version identifiers, and technical instrumentation. These fonts must be served in a way that guarantees:

1. **Zero layout shift**
2. **Consistent rendering across platforms**
3. **Clear fallback sequencing when the webfont is unavailable**

#### **Webfont Delivery Requirements**

* Fonts must be self-hosted inside the Transcrypt CDN, not pulled from third-party providers.
  No Google Fonts, no externally hosted CSS.

* Supported formats:
  **WOFF2** (primary), **WOFF** (fallback for legacy).
  No TTF, OTF, or EOT.

* Preload directives must be used for critical weights:
  `400`, `500`, `600` for IBM Plex Sans.
  `400` for IBM Plex Mono.

* Rendering strategy must use:
  `font-display: optional;`
  This avoids flash-of-invisible-text and prevents content shifts.

* CSS must define absolute, explicit fallback chains:

  ```
  font-family: "IBM Plex Sans", system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI",
                Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  ```

Fallback chains must always prioritise legibility and rhythm. The purpose is a graceful degradation path — never an expressive replacement.

#### **PDF and Export Requirements**

PDF exports embed the fonts directly.
IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono must be included in the export pipeline so that regulatory documents render identically on every machine, online or offline.
No user system font may be substituted at export time.

#### **Non-Web Environments**

Native app shells or embedded components must use the same explicit stacks.
If IBM Plex is not available locally, system fallbacks must still preserve spacing and structure.

---

### 5.3.2 Weight and Style Usage

Transcrypt uses a deliberately narrow weight range. This guards against visual drift and maintains the engineered, serious tone of the system.

The permitted weights:

* **IBM Plex Sans 400** — body text (default)
* **IBM Plex Sans 500** — labels, minor emphasis, supporting headings
* **IBM Plex Sans 600** — H1–H3 structural headings only
* **IBM Plex Mono 400** — code, IDs, technical notation

All other weights (100, 200, 300, 700, 800) are prohibited.

#### **Prohibited behaviours**

* No italics across any surface, including marketing materials.
  Italics introduce expressive slant and break the system’s engineered monotone.

* No faux-bolding or synthetic weight creation.
  Only the weights actually provided by IBM Plex may be used.

* No letterform distortion (tracking hacks, negative letter-spacing, or condensed/expanded variants).

* No text-shadow, glow, or other decorative styling — including hover or focus states.

* No colour emphasis outside approved palette rules (see §4).
  Accent colour may be used for interactive states only.

#### **Size and Role Mapping**

Sizes are not fixed here (they belong in CSS), but their relationships are:

* Each heading downshifts by a predictable ratio.
* Body text is always the baseline scale.
* Meta text is always smaller than body text, never equal.
* Mono text never exceeds the body text size.

This consistency lets users parse structure subconsciously, the same way they parse indentation in code.

---

## 5.4 Pairing and Spacing Conventions

Typography in Transcrypt is engineered, not expressive. Pairing rules and spacing conventions exist to create predictable visual rhythm across screens, documents, diagrams, and exports. The aim is consistency, not personality. Every component inherits these rules so that headings, body text, mono text, and metadata align with the same internal logic.

Typography is treated the same way as code formatting: strict, repeatable, immune to stylistic improvisation.

---

### 5.4.1 Pairing Rules

Pairing defines how IBM Plex Sans (UI text) and IBM Plex Mono (technical text) coexist. The relationship is functional, not decorative.

#### **Sans → Mono roles must always remain distinct**

* **IBM Plex Sans** handles narrative text: headings, body, labels, annotations.
* **IBM Plex Mono** handles structured data: code, rulepack IDs, API payloads, hashes, runbook steps, version strings, tenant identifiers, and architectural parameters.

Mono is never used for headings or long-form copy. Sans is never used for code or identifiers.

#### **Mixed-content blocks follow a strict pattern**

Whenever mono and sans appear together (e.g., in a rule explanation or technical note):

* Sans introduces or frames the content.
* Mono displays the exact value, name, or parameter.

Example:

> Evidence bucket: `tenant-4A73/export/2025-02-14.json`

Sans contextualises; mono carries the truth.

#### **Heading–body pairing is fixed**

* H1–H3 always use **IBM Plex Sans 600**.
* Body text always uses **IBM Plex Sans 400**.

H4+ is treated as body-scale text with weight 500. No exception.

This prevents overly deep or creative heading hierarchies. If more structure is needed, spacing — not font weight — creates it.

#### **No expressive pairing behaviours**

* No typeface substitutions.
* No alternate fonts for marketing, campaigns, or “special” pages.
* No seasonal variants, playful accents, or personality-driven pairings.

Transcrypt’s brand stays cold and consistent, even in marketing surfaces.

---

### 5.4.2 Tracking and Leading

Spacing is not stylistic; it is a readability constraint. Tracking (letter-spacing) and leading (line height) ensure that the system is legible on every device and in every export format.

#### **Tracking Rules**

Tracking must never be manually adjusted except for specific cases:

* **Uppercase labels** may use slight increased tracking to maintain clarity, but never beyond +2%.
* **Headings** use the typeface defaults — no stretch, no compression.
* **Mono text** uses *default* monospaced spacing. No added tracking.

Absolute prohibitions:

* No negative tracking.
* No tightening headings for “aesthetic compactness.”
* No platform-specific tracking overrides (e.g., iOS tight headings).

Consistency beats aesthetics.

#### **Leading Rules**

Line height follows a strict scale to maintain vertical rhythm:

* **Body text**: ~1.5 line height relative to font size.
  (Large enough for audit documents, long tables, and dense content.)

* **Headings (H1–H3)**: tighter leading, between 1.1 and 1.25 depending on size.
  Headings must sit close to their block — never float.

* **Mono text**: ~1.4 line height for legibility in code and terminal-style blocks.

* **Meta text** (small annotations): consistent with body rhythm; never tighter than 1.35.

#### **Vertical Rhythm Rules**

Typography aligns with the 4/8/12 spacing grid used across product screens:

* Text blocks always sit on multiples of **4px** spacing units.
* No arbitrary manual nudging.
* Headings always have more spacing *above* than below, to visually group them with their content block.

This creates a predictable reading cadence: headings introduce, body follows, and components stack cleanly.

#### **Export and Print Leading**

Because PDFs compress text differently:

* Line height in exported documents must be slightly increased (1.55–1.6 for body) to avoid cramped text in regulatory printouts.
* This is enforced by the export stylesheet, not the web stylesheet.

---

# 6. Iconography and Illustration Style

Transcrypt’s icon system is built on Feather Icons (MIT-licensed) as the sole icon source. Feather provides the geometric base: a 24×24 grid, minimal outlines, and neutral metaphors. Icons are selected from Feather as needed, lightly adjusted where required, and saved as local SVG assets in the repo. All icons used in Transcrypt must conform to the rules in this section, regardless of their origin.

## 6.1 Icon Style Principles

Icons in Transcrypt are simple, neutral line icons based on a 24×24 grid. The visual model is derived from Feather Icons: clean outlines, no fills by default, and no expressive or playful metaphors. Icons exist to support comprehension, not to add character or decoration.

All icons must:
- Use a 24×24 canvas
- Follow a single, consistent stroke weight
- Avoid texture, gradients, shadows, and depth
- Use widely recognised metaphors only
- Remain visually quiet and subordinate to typography and layout

---

### 6.1.1 Line Weight and Geometry

Transcrypt icons use a **single 2px stroke weight** built on Feather’s 24×24 grid.
Geometry must read as engineered, not stylised. Shapes are clean, angular where appropriate, and always snapped to the pixel grid.

Rules that apply to every icon:

* **Stroke weight is fixed.** No variation, no dual weights, no “thin” or “bold” icon sets.
* **Stroke caps and joins are round**, matching Feather’s default.
* **No fill paths** except in rare cases where a 16×16 reduction becomes illegible.
* **All contours must align to the 24×24 coordinate system**. No off-grid coordinates such as 12.3, 7.8, 18.25.
* **Curves must remain minimal and low-tension.** No decorative flourishes.
* **Corners follow a consistent rounding profile**, identical across icons.
* **Icons must not exceed or undershoot the 24×24 frame.** Overscan, negative offsets, or “mask bleed” are prohibited.
* **Boolean operations (union, subtract, intersect) must be clean** — no micro-nodes, no overlapping segments, no fractional gaps.

The aim is mechanical precision. The icons should feel like schematics, not drawings.

Icons that appear visually softer, more playful, or more expressive than Feather’s geometry must be rejected or rewritten.

---

### 6.1.2 Contrast and Legibility

Icons in Transcrypt must maintain **WCAG-compliant contrast** and remain legible across both light and dark surfaces. Because the icon system is outline-based and unfilled, contrast management is essential.

Rules:

* On **light surfaces**, icons must use `--neutral-800` or `--neutral-900`.
* On **dark surfaces**, icons must use `--brand-surface-0` (pure white).
* On **accent backgrounds**, icons are prohibited. Accent surfaces are never used as icon backdrops.
* Icons must always appear at 1:1 pixel alignment at the intended display size.
  Anti-aliased blur introduced by fractional scaling is considered a rendering defect.
* At **16×16**, if the icon loses clarity (e.g., too many intersecting paths), it must be manually simplified.
  No upscaling hacks are permitted.
* Icons must not use opacity variation to simulate contrast.
  100% opacity strokes only.
* Icons must remain visible when exported to PDF, printed in greyscale, or viewed on low-quality displays.
  Any icon that relies on subtle stroke contrast or colour is invalid.

The icon system must read cleanly at a glance: neutral, sparse, and unambiguous. Anything that demands “interpretation” has already violated the intent.

---

## 6.2 Line Weight, Corners, and Scale

This section defines the non-negotiable geometric rules that govern every icon used in Transcrypt. These rules ensure that all icons — whether sourced directly from Feather or lightly adjusted — behave as a single engineered system. Stroke weight, corner behaviour, and scaling constraints are fixed. No icon may deviate from these specifications.

Icons are not expressive assets. They are functional glyphs with precise geometric boundaries. Any variation in stroke consistency, corner rounding, or scale introduces visual drift and undermines the clarity required across UI, diagrams, and exported documents.

---

## **6.2.1 Stroke Rules**

Stroke behaviour in Transcrypt is uniform and strictly controlled. Every icon in the system must use the same engineered outline structure to maintain clarity, contrast, and predictable rendering.

**1. Single stroke weight**
All icons must use a **fixed 2px stroke weight** based on the Feather baseline.
No thin, bold, variable, or multi-weight icons are permitted.

**2. Round caps and round joins**
Stroke caps and joins must always be **round**, matching Feather geometry.
No mitered, beveled, square, or stylistic join behaviours.

**3. No fill paths**
Icons are outline-only. Fill shapes are prohibited except where a 16×16 reduction becomes unreadable and only a minimal filled form preserves legibility. Such exceptions must be rare and purely functional.

**4. Pixel-grid alignment**
All stroke endpoints, control points, and anchor nodes must align to whole-pixel coordinates within the 24×24 frame.
Fractional coordinates (e.g. 12.4, 7.8) are prohibited.

**5. Clean geometry only**
Icons must contain no stray nodes, doubled paths, overlapping strokes, micro-segments, or boolean artifacts.

**6. No stroke scaling**
Strokes must not thicken, thin, distort, or scale disproportionately when icons are resized.
If an icon needs to appear at a different size, it must scale uniformly within the constraints defined in §6.2.2.

**7. No stylistic variations**
No textured strokes, dashed lines, broken lines, pressure-sensitive curves, or variable-width strokes.
Icons must remain mechanically consistent.

The stroke system is intentionally rigid. Its purpose is clarity, not expression.

---

## **6.2.2 Scaling Constraints**

Scaling rules ensure that icons remain legible and mechanically stable across all contexts — UI chrome, diagrams, PDFs, and micro-scale surfaces such as favicons. Icons must not distort or behave unpredictably when resized.

**1. Native size: 24×24**
All icons are authored in, and optimised for, a **24×24 coordinate system**.
This is the canonical size for evaluation and alignment.

**2. Approved display sizes**
Icons may be displayed at:

* **24×24** (default for UI and diagrams)
* **20×20** (secondary UI contexts)
* **16×16** (compact UI or metadata contexts)

Sizes such as 18px, 22px, or any fractional scaling (e.g. 13.5px) are prohibited. They generate anti-aliased blur and destroy geometric consistency.

**3. 16×16 simplification**
If an icon becomes visually ambiguous at 16×16, a **manually simplified variant** must be produced.
Simplification rules:

* Remove non-essential internal paths
* Reduce intersections
* Preserve silhouette only
* Maintain stroke weight and round joins

This is not a redesign; it is a functional reduction.

**4. No upscaling beyond intended use**
Icons must not be enlarged beyond **32×32** except in rare documentation diagrams where the icon acts as a directional marker.
Icons may never be used as decorative oversized illustrations.

**5. No distortion during scaling**
Scaling must be uniform.
No horizontal/vertical stretching, shearing, perspective transforms, or manual “nudging.”

**6. No container-dependent scaling hacks**
Icons must not stretch to fill arbitrary shapes, buttons, or layout slots. Containers must be designed to respect the icon’s fixed ratio.

**7. PDF and print fidelity**
Icons must remain legible when exported to PDF or printed in monochrome.
If an icon loses clarity in print at small sizes, the simplified 16×16 variant must be used instead of scaling the 24×24 master.

The scaling system ensures that Transcrypt icons behave with the same deterministic logic as the product itself: consistent, predictable, and structurally unambiguous.

## 6.3 Illustration Tone and Style
### 6.3.1 Principles of Illustration
### 6.3.2 Use of Metaphor

## 6.4 Do and Don’t Patterns
### 6.4.1 Acceptable Use
### 6.4.2 Forbidden Use

## 6.5 Icon Usage Rules

Transcrypt uses Feather Icons (MIT licensed) as the sole source for all icons in product, marketing, and documentation. Icons are used directly from the Feather set, with adjustments only when required for clarity or alignment.

### 6.5.1 Source of Truth

All icons used in the product must be stored locally in the repository under:

/assets/icons/

This ensures visibility, consistency, and reusability.

### 6.5.2 Usage Approach

Icons are selected from Feather as needed. Adjustments are permitted for:

- Stroke weight alignment  
- Corner consistency  
- Metaphor clarity  

Raw Feather icons should not be used directly from the CDN or package. Always place the final SVG in the repo.

### 6.5.3 Style Alignment

All icons must:

- Use a 24×24 grid  
- Maintain consistent outline stroke weight  
- Avoid fills, colour variations, gradients, or expressive metaphors  
- Remain neutral and functional in tone  

### 6.5.4 No Icon Approval Workflow

As a single-designer system, no formal icon approval or governance process exists. The repository history provides the audit trail.

### 6.5.5 Adding New Icons

When a new icon is needed:

1. Select or adapt a Feather icon.  
2. Add it to `/assets/icons/`.  
3. Use it wherever required.

Icons do not require a pre-defined inventory.

# 7. Imagery and Photography

Imagery in Transcrypt operates on a **two-surface model**:
the **Product surface**, where clarity and neutrality dominate, and the **Marketing surface**, where high-craft visual expression is permitted.
Both surfaces share the same conceptual spine — seriousness, technical competence, and truthfulness — but apply it with different levels of visual intensity.

The **Product imagery** supports comprehension, documentation, and trust.
It avoids dramatics, avoids personality, and avoids anything that competes with structure or typography. It is documentary in tone: clear lighting, honest subjects, no atmosphere added in post. Product imagery exists to *explain*.

The **Marketing imagery** is allowed to be visually persuasive.
It may use controlled cinematic lighting, depth cues, atmospheric gradients, soft glows, structured abstractions, and motion-led composition — as long as these treatments remain technical rather than whimsical. Marketing imagery exists to *signal capability, confidence, and modernity* without drifting into consumer gloss.

Across both surfaces, the imagery system must adhere to three principles:

1. **Truthful substance over aesthetic trickery.**
   Nothing may distort the nature of the product or exaggerate its capabilities.

2. **A technical visual tone.**
   Imagery should feel engineered, intentional, and grounded in the realities of operational security, not inspired by lifestyle design or entertainment aesthetics.

3. **Consistency of message, not uniformity of style.**
   Product and Marketing serve different purposes and therefore use different treatments — but both must reinforce that Transcrypt is serious, disciplined, and built for people who handle risk professionally.

This section defines subject matter, mood, composition rules, and treatment standards for both surfaces, ensuring that imagery consistently communicates Transcrypt’s competence and restraint, whether guiding an auditor through evidence or introducing the product on a landing page.

---

## 7.1 Subject Matter and Mood

Imagery used by Transcrypt must support clarity, context, and comprehension. It must not introduce emotion, narrative, or personality. The subject matter must remain functional, deliberate, and directly relevant to the domain of cybersecurity, structured systems, and operational environments. The mood must always be neutral and controlled — aligned with the brand’s engineered posture and its responsibility to reduce cognitive noise.

Imagery is a **supporting component**, never a lead element. If an image does not directly improve understanding, it is removed.

---

### **7.1.1 Thematic Constraints**

All imagery must fall within a narrow set of permissible themes. These themes reflect Transcrypt’s identity: structured, technical, calm, and grounded in real operational environments.

Permitted thematic categories:

#### **1. Real-world operational detail**

Images that capture infrastructure, devices, networks, or physical environments relevant to security and compliance.

Examples:

* server racks (unbranded, calm lighting)
* network hardware
* workstations, devices, cabling
* industrial or office environments without people

Purpose: contextual grounding without implying excitement or drama.

#### **2. Abstract structural forms**

Geometric, minimal imagery that reinforces ideas of structure, containment, or ordered systems.

Examples:

* grid patterns
* controlled linework
* modular shapes
* architectural abstractions (not artistic flourishes)

Purpose: reinforce clarity and system behaviour visually.

#### **3. Documentation-oriented imagery**

Screens, forms, structured content, checklists, diagrams — shown only to reinforce product comprehension.

Examples:

* evidence structures
* interface elements (desaturated, non-interactive)
* flow diagrams
* architecture snippets

Purpose: support understanding, not sell features.

#### **4. Environmentally neutral textures**

Muted, minimal textures that provide subtle depth without resembling consumer branding or mood photography.

Examples:

* concrete
* brushed metal
* matte surfaces

Purpose: support, not dominate.

#### **5. Tools and artefacts**

Objects that are part of real-world compliance work.

Examples:

* notebooks
* pens
* routers
* reference documents

Purpose: ground the system in reality, without metaphor.

---

### **7.1.2 Avoided Subjects**

Certain subjects are prohibited because they introduce emotion, personality, narrative, or thematic drift. They destabilise the brand and conflict with its obligation to remain calm, precise, and non-expressive.

The following categories are **forbidden**:

#### **1. People**

No faces, models, hands, teams, meetings, or “human connection” imagery.
People introduce emotion, bias, personality, and narrative — all incompatible with Transcrypt’s neutral system identity.

#### **2. Emotional or atmospheric photography**

No moody lighting, sunsets, skylines, abstract flares, bokeh, or cinematic imagery.

These add narrative tone, not clarity.

#### **3. Metaphorical content**

No keys, locks, shields, padlocks, mazes, lighthouses, bridges, animals, or any symbolic representation of “security.”

Metaphor violates the deterministic, literal identity of Transcrypt.

#### **4. Consumer-tech aesthetics**

No glowing keyboards, RGB-lit racks, dramatic server close-ups, neon-lit rooms, or hacker-themed imagery.

These signal theatricality, not trust.

#### **5. Stock photography tropes**

No people at laptops, handshakes, posed “professionals,” stick-figure iconography, or artificial composite images.

These undermine credibility and introduce inconsistent tone.

#### **6. Playful or stylised visuals**

No illustrations or photographs with:

* cartoonish style
* exaggerated colour
* expressive shape language
* trendy gradients

These are incompatible with the brand’s engineered seriousness.

#### **7. Branded environments**

No office shots, billboards, swag, or lifestyle photography implying a corporate culture.

The brand is a system — not a lifestyle.

---

## 7.2 Composition Rules

Imagery used by Transcrypt must be composed in a way that reinforces clarity, neutrality, and structural order. Composition cannot introduce drama, narrative, or personality. All framing, cropping, and perspective choices must reduce cognitive noise and keep attention on information, not aesthetics.

The composition system exists to prevent expressive visual behaviour and to ensure that images feel like part of the same engineered environment across the marketing site, documentation, and product surfaces.

---

### **7.2.1 Cropping and Framing**

Cropping rules ensure that imagery remains functional, neutral, and free from emotional or narrative cues. Images must be cropped to remove visual noise, irrelevant content, and any elements that imply personality, human presence, or mood.

#### **1. Subject-first, environment-second**

The subject (hardware, documentation, structured objects) must occupy a clear, stable region of the frame. Extraneous background must be reduced or removed.

Permitted:

* clean object-centred crops
* straight-on framing around structured forms
* tightly controlled negative space

Prohibited:

* artistic off-centre compositions
* aesthetic “empty space” used for emotional effect
* visual storytelling through framing

#### **2. Always square or rectilinear crops**

Aspect ratios must remain mechanically neutral.

Permitted ratios:

* 1:1
* 4:3
* 16:9
* 3:2

Prohibited:

* cinematic ultrawide ratios
* asymmetrical or decorative crops
* non-rectangular shapes

Images must not be masked inside circles, hexagons, soft shapes, or decorative containers.

#### **3. Zero dynamic cropping**

Do not crop to create drama, suggest action, or draw emotional focus.

Examples of prohibited cropping:

* partial close-ups implying motion
* angled crops of devices
* abstract crops that obscure context

Clarity outweighs visual interest.

#### **4. Grid-aligned framing**

Major verticals and horizontals in the image must align with the brand’s grid logic where practical.
Cropping must avoid tilt, horizon skew, or off-axis framing unless the subject itself is fixed at an angle.

#### **5. Remove humans if present**

If an otherwise acceptable image contains people or body parts:

* crop them out cleanly
* or discard the image

Hands, silhouettes, and partial limbs are treated as full human presence and are prohibited.

---

### **7.2.2 Perspective and Depth**

Perspective rules ensure that images maintain a calm, technical character. Depth must be minimal, controlled, and free from cinematic behaviour. Imagery must remain literal and documentary, not expressive.

#### **1. Neutral, front-facing perspective only**

Permitted perspectives:

* straight-on (orthographic-style)
* mild three-quarter angles when structural clarity benefits

Prohibited:

* dynamic angles
* low vantage points
* high “hero” camera positions
* wide-angle distortion

Perspective must never suggest speed, action, elevation, or drama.

#### **2. Minimal depth-of-field**

Shallow depth-of-field introduces mood; therefore it is prohibited.

Rules:

* Images must be in focus across the majority of the frame
* Background blur must be functional, not atmospheric

No bokeh, no soft-focus, no cinematic blur.

#### **3. No exaggerated foreground/background separation**

Avoid images where the subject is sharply isolated against a soft or atmospheric background.
Acceptable depth separation must be subtle and documentary in character.

#### **4. Avoid vanishing points and strong convergence**

Images must not use perspective lines that:

* pull the viewer into the frame
* add implied motion
* create dramatic recession

Hardware or architecture images must be taken with neutral lens settings to avoid distortion.

#### **5. Shadow behaviour must be minimal**

Shadows may exist but must not:

* dramatise form
* create contrast spikes
* imply mood or time-of-day narrative

Soft, neutral shadows only — or none at all.

#### **6. Flat lay is permitted but must not be stylised**

Flat-lay images are allowed if:

* the subject matter is technical or operational (devices, documents, tools)
* spacing is orderly
* the scene is not decorative

Flat-lays must *never* mimic lifestyle photography.

#### **7. Architecture/diagram perspective**

When images contain screens, documents, or structured artefacts:

* perspective must be kept close to orthographic
* edges must remain straight, not keystone-distorted
* no simulated 3D, extruded shadows, or angled “mockups”

The rule is: **clarity over realism, realism over style**.

---

## 7.3 Colour Treatment and Filters

Colour treatment ensures that imagery never introduces emotion, warmth, or stylistic drift. All images must be processed in a way that reinforces the neutral, engineered character of the brand. Filters must support clarity and reduce noise — not create mood, drama, or visual personality.

Transcrypt imagery must appear quiet, technical, and documentary.
Colour is functional, not expressive.

---

### **7.3.1 Standard Treatments**

Permitted treatments are narrowly defined and exist solely to maintain clarity, consistency, and print/export reliability. Any treatment not explicitly listed is considered out-of-system.

#### **1. Neutral Desaturation (5–20%)**

A small degree of desaturation is allowed to:

* remove emotional warmth
* reduce colour variance across images
* unify mixed lighting sources

Desaturation must be minimal.
Images must *not* appear monochrome unless they originated that way.

#### **2. Soft Contrast Equalisation**

A controlled contrast curve ensures legibility without drama.

Permitted adjustments:

* small lift of shadows to remove harsh depth
* controlled highlight compression to prevent glare
* mild midtone balancing for clarity

No punch, no cinematic contrast.

#### **3. Temperature Correction**

Only functional temperature changes are allowed:

* remove warm indoor casts
* neutralise mixed lighting
* restore daylight neutrality

Images must move towards **cool-neutral** (but never icy or stylised).

#### **4. Grain Removal**

If an image contains digital noise or grain, it should be minimised.
However:

* no stylised “softening”
* no skin smoothing
* no blur beyond minimal noise reduction

#### **5. Linear Sharpening**

A restrained sharpening pass is allowed to maintain clarity of:

* device edges
* screens
* documents
* technical objects

Sharpening must be subtle, never crisp or stylised.

#### **6. Exposure Normalisation**

All images must sit within a controlled luminosity range:

* no high-key brightness
* no low-key darkness
* no silhouettes

The goal is readability, not atmosphere.

#### **7. Unified Colour Profile**

Images must be exported using:

* **sRGB** for web
* **embedded CMYK-safe sRGB** equivalent for print-safe exports

This prevents unexpected saturation shifts.

---

### **7.3.2 Prohibited Filters**

Transcrypt does not use stylised photography. Any treatment that introduces mood, personality, or cinematic tone is prohibited. Images must remain literal, documentary, and neutral — aligned with the product’s purpose of clarity and inspection.

The following are not permitted on any marketing, product, documentation, or export surface:

### **1. Cinematic or Expressive Colour Manipulation**

No strong colour washes, tinted overlays, colour grading, or mood-setting palettes.
Images may not be made warmer, cooler, softer, harsher, or more dramatic.

### **2. High-Style Contrast Manipulation**

No heavy shadows, lifted blacks, crushed highlights, or stylised tonal curves designed to evoke atmosphere.

### **3. Noise, Grain, or Texture Effects**

No film grain, noise overlays, matte textures, halation, bloom, or vintage film emulation.

### **4. Softening or Glow Effects**

No skin-smoothing, glow blooms, bloom highlights, or atmospheric haze.

### **5. Artificial Vignettes or Edge Treatments**

No darkened corners, spotlighting effects, lens vignettes, or radial emphasis.

### **6. **No Stylising Effects (Unified Rule)**

Images must not use:

* colour-isolation or channel-picking
* gradient colour overlays
* brand-colour filters
* blurs, Gaussian blur, background art blur, bokeh simulations
* duotone, tritone, posterisation, or any illustrative processing

These treatments introduce theatrics and contradict Transcrypt’s documentary tone.

---

## 7.4 Prohibited Imagery

Prohibited imagery exists to prevent accidental drift into emotional framing, metaphor, theatrics, or anything that could misrepresent Transcrypt’s purpose.
If an image risks introducing personality, narrative, or implication beyond literal documentation, it must not be used.

This section defines the classes of imagery that are structurally incompatible with Transcrypt.

---

### **7.4.1 Brand Integrity Risks**

These categories undermine the brand’s engineered, neutral posture and therefore cannot appear on any surface — marketing, product, documentation, PDF exports, or social.

#### **1. Metaphorical or Symbolic Imagery**

No symbols intended to represent concepts indirectly, including:

* locks, shields, keys
* padlocks in clouds
* maze metaphors
* heroic or aspirational symbols
* abstract “cyber swirls” or neon networks

Transcrypt does not use metaphor to communicate security.

#### **2. Emotional or Performative Imagery**

Any image designed to evoke excitement, fear, energy, humour, warmth, or drama is prohibited.

Examples:

* smiling office teams
* stressed employees with laptops
* triumph/failure depictions
* emotional human expression of any kind

The brand must remain calm, neutral, and untheatrical.

#### **3. Stylised Cyber or Tech Aesthetic**

No “cyberpunk,” neon, gridlines, holographic elements, digital distortion, glowing edges, or matrix-style motifs.

These imply emotion, futurism, or magical systems — all incompatible with Transcrypt’s deterministic architecture.

#### **4. Decorative or Mood-Setting Images**

No imagery whose primary role is aesthetic rather than informational.

Examples:

* abstract patterns
* stylised backgrounds
* bokeh or depth-of-field theatrics

Transcrypt does not use imagery to decorate or evoke mood.

#### **5. Stock Photography with Brand Personality**

Any stock photography that attempts to portray:

* “innovation”
* “collaboration”
* “digital transformation”
* “team culture”

is forbidden. These introduce narrative and personality.

---

### **7.4.2 Misleading or Off-Brand Content**

These categories risk distorting expectations or implying behaviours, capabilities, or workflows that Transcrypt does not provide.

#### **1. Implied Security Guarantees**

Images suggesting:

* hacks being blocked
* shields deflecting attacks
* glowing data streams
* people “protecting” devices

These misrepresent what the platform does and violate PRD boundaries.

#### **2. Imagery Suggesting Human “Advisory” or Consultancy**

Transcrypt does not present itself as a consultancy or human-led service.

Prohibited:

* people looking over shoulders
* meetings across laptops
* advisors pointing at screens
* handshakes or partnership symbolism

The platform is system-led, not people-led.

#### **3. Misleading setting or context**

No imagery implying environments Transcrypt does not operate in:

* server rooms
* SOC dashboards
* datacentres
* threat-hunting teams
* analysts in headsets

Transcrypt is a compliance product, not a monitoring, SOC, or ops platform.

#### **4. Illustrations or Photography Implying Emotion, Persona, or Narrative**

Prohibited:

* character illustrations
* mascots
* cartoons
* emotive portraits
* stylised sketches

Transcrypt does not anthropomorphise, storytell, or entertain.

#### **5. Misleading Depictions of Process**

Images must not:

* imply automation the system does not perform
* show workflows that differ from those defined in the PDS
* depict incorrect regulatory steps
* suggest results or guarantees the system cannot provide

#### **6. Any Image That Competes With the Identity System**

If an image introduces:

* strong tone
* personality
* narrative
* colour dominance
* visual noise

…it is off-brand.

---

# 8. Layout and Composition

Layout in Transcrypt is not a creative gesture — it is an operational constraint.
Where the PRD defines purpose and the SAIS defines architecture, layout defines **how information is physically arranged** so the system reads with the same determinism it is built on.

Transcrypt’s layout model is engineered, not expressive.
It enforces:

* predictable structure
* stable margins
* consistent rhythm
* repeatable grid behaviour
* strict separation between content and chrome
* zero ambiguity in spacing or alignment

Every surface — marketing, app, documentation, exports — must read as part of a single, coherent system. That system privileges **clarity, hierarchy, and precision** above all else. There is no decorative layout, no ornamental composition, and no “designer drift.” If a layout pattern cannot be described, reproduced, and validated, it is not part of Transcrypt.

This section defines:

1. **Grid systems and margins** for mobile, tablet, and desktop
2. **Canonical page templates** for core touchpoints
3. **Vertical rhythm and spacing hierarchy** (the spacing logic that everything inherits)
4. **Brand patterns and their extremely limited use**
5. **Motion and interaction identity** rules
6. **Audio rules** for rare cases where sound is permitted

These rules ensure that every page, component, and visual structure behaves like engineered infrastructure — stable, legible, and resistant to aesthetic drift — while still giving the marketing layer the flexibility it needs to operate at its expected level of polish.

This is the determinism of the SAIS expressed as visuals:
**no surprises, no improvisation, no ambiguity.**

---

## 8.1 Brand Grids and Margins

Transcrypt’s layout system is built on a stable, predictable grid that behaves the same across the marketing site, the Essentials app, documentation surfaces, and exported materials. The grid does not express personality; it enforces structure. Every layout decision — spacing, rhythm, column width, breakpoints, and margins — must derive from the rules in this section.

The system is characterised by three traits:

1. **Determinism:** layouts collapse and expand according to fixed breakpoints, not designer preference.
2. **Clarity:** columns and gutters are generous enough to support dense technical content.
3. **Consistency:** the same spatial logic applies across product, docs, and exports.

Transcrypt avoids improvisational, fluid, or “creative” grid decisions. The grid exists to stop drift, not enable it.

---

## **8.1.1 Grid Options**

The grid system has three modes tied to device classes, each optimised for clarity and touch accuracy rather than ornamental flexibility.

### **Mobile Grid (≤ 480px)**

**2-column fixed grid**

* Columns: **2**
* Gutter: **16px**
* Outer margins: **20–24px**
* Text spans: **always 2 columns**
* Cards: full width or half width only
* No nested grids permitted

Rationale: Four-column mobile grids look clever until the user tries to tap or read anything. Transcrypt demands clarity and predictable reading, not marketing density.

### **Tablet Grid (481–880px)**

**4–6 column grid depending on surface**

* Product UI: **4 columns**
* Marketing & content pages: **6 columns**
* Gutter: **20px**
* Outer margins: **32px**

Rationale: Tablet is the bridge state where marketing gains slightly more freedom, but product UI remains controlled and text-first.

### **Desktop Grid (≥ 880px)**

**12-column grid — the system’s backbone**

* Columns: **12**
* Gutter: **24–32px**
* Max content width: **1200–1320px**
* Sidebars: multiples of 3 columns
* Content regions: multiples of 4 columns

Rationale: This is where the identity is most visible. The grid must be unambiguous and robust enough for complex documentation, dense tables, diagrams, and multi-panel product screens.

### **Print and Export Grid (PDF & long-form docs)**

**Single or dual-column scientific layout**

* Single column: **preferred default**
* Dual column: **only for dense technical material**
* Margins: **larger, fixed, conservative**
* No responsive behaviour

Rationale: Technical documentation should read like evidence, not a website.

---

## **8.1.2 Margin Rules**

Margins are structural boundaries, not “white space choices.” They enforce containment, focus, and visual calm. Inconsistent margins create drift; fixed margins enforce discipline.

### **Core Margin Rules (All Surfaces)**

* Outer margins are **always larger** than internal gutters.
* Margins must **increase** with screen size.
* No element may “kiss” the viewport edge except full-bleed hero imagery on marketing surfaces.
* Margins define the rhythm; content never overrides them.

### **Mobile Margin Rules**

* Default margin: **20–24px**
* Do not collapse below **16px**
* Buttons, pills, and chips must retain **at least 12px** breathing room from edges.

### **Tablet Margin Rules**

* Default margin: **32px**
* May expand to **40px** on text-heavy surfaces
* No mixed-margin layouts allowed (e.g., uneven left/right).

### **Desktop Margin Rules**

* Standard margin: **48–64px**
* Hero sections may use **compensated margins** for proportion (e.g., 72px top, 64px sides).
* All documentation pages, system dashboards, and tables must sit inside the same margin boundary for consistency.

### **PDF / Print Margin Rules**

* Minimum margin: **20–25mm**
* Wider top margin for metadata, headers, and audit details
* No decorative bleed, no edge-to-edge colour

---

## 8.2 Key Page Templates

Transcrypt’s outward-facing surfaces follow a small set of deterministic templates. These templates establish the structural identity of the brand – the shapes, rhythms, and sequencing that make a page recognisably Transcrypt before colour, typography, or graphics are considered.

This section defines the canonical layouts for marketing surfaces. These patterns are not aesthetic suggestions; they are behavioural rules. They keep the brand coherent while giving the single author (you) room to refine, iterate, and A/B test inside stable constraints.

Templates do not restrict creativity – they prevent entropy. They give every page a predictable skeleton so that experimentation affects performance, not identity.

A/B testing is fully permitted on all marketing surfaces. As a single-author system, Transcrypt relies on consistent judgement rather than multi-team governance. Experiments may explore copy, density, illustration usage, or block sequencing, provided they do not violate the colour system, grid rules, motion envelope, or typographic standards defined elsewhere in this guide.

---

## **8.2.1 Landing Pages**

Landing pages are the highest-authority marketing surfaces. They introduce Transcrypt to new visitors and must embody the brand’s core personality: engineered, sober, and technically competent. These pages must feel stable and trustworthy at first glance.

### **Page Structure Requirements**

Landing pages follow a fixed upstream structure. Minor variations are allowed, but the order must remain intact:

1. **Hero Block**

   * Always present, always above the fold.
   * Single clear headline with grounded, non-flamboyant language.
   * Optional eyebrow line for categorisation.
   * No theatrical motion. Micro-animations only (opacity, subtle translation).
   * Hero may contain:

     * system diagram
     * abstract geometric pattern from §8.4
     * neutral photography (only if tied to the narrative)
   * Button layout: primary → secondary. No more than two.

2. **Narrative / Value Block**

   * “What Transcrypt does and why it matters.”
   * Uses the 12-column grid on desktop, 2-column on mobile.
   * No marketing gloss (no gradient blobs, no neon colour, no fake depth).

3. **Credibility Layer**

   * Lightweight proof points: standards mapping, diagrams, logos, audit-oriented language.
   * No testimonial animations, carousels, or auto-rotating elements.

4. **Product Slice**

   * A sober, deep-focused view into a key feature or process.
   * Uses dark base backgrounds with light-surface cutouts.
   * Icons permitted (Feather-based only).

5. **Secondary CTA / Closing Block**

   * One CTA only.
   * May include a miniature diagram or a few short supporting bullets.

### **A/B Testing Guidance**

Allowed tests include:

* headline variants
* CTA wording/ordering
* presence/absence of the narrative block
* illustration vs diagram in the hero
* density variations (tight vs spacious)
* micro-motion tuning
* alternative eyebrow patterns

Prohibited tests:

* adding new colours
* introducing new visual metaphors
* unconventional grid structures
* dramatic motion (parallax, zooms, scroll hijacks)
* hero images outside photography/diagram/pattern rules

Landing pages must always look like engineered infrastructure, not a startup pitch.

---

## **8.2.2 Campaign and Feature Pages**

Campaign and Feature Pages are lower-authority but more expressive surfaces. They support detailed explanations, initiatives, comparisons, announcements, and deep dives. These pages are allowed to “breathe” more than landing pages but remain bound to the identity system.

### **Page Structure Requirements**

These pages can use a more flexible sequence of blocks, but must still follow:

* the 12-column desktop grid
* the 2-column mobile grid
* Transcrypt spacing rhythm
* the cerulean-only accent discipline
* sober photographic treatment
* Feather-aligned iconography
* motion envelope from §8.5

Typical blocks include:

* narrative explainer
* diagram stack
* feature comparison
* deep content slice (long-form)
* system demonstration graphic
* optional video (only if documentary or screen-capture style)

### **Expanded Flexibility**

Campaign/feature pages may:

* reorder content blocks
* include more diagrams and illustrations
* use more complex multi-column layouts
* incorporate animation (inside the motion envelope)
* run A/B tests on block ordering and density
* include optional background patterns from §8.4

They may **not** introduce:

* new grid sizes
* additional accent colours
* stylised photography
* high-emotion marketing visuals
* motion exceeding the micro-range

### **CTA Rules**

* CTAs appear after meaningful narrative or proof.
* No hero-style CTA stacking.
* One CTA per major block, two max on the entire page.

### **A/B Testing Guidance**

Allowed:

* testing narrative length
* alternate diagram types
* presence/absence of supporting imagery
* changing pacing between blocks
* denser vs lighter layouts
* scroll-responsive micro-motion

Prohibited:

* testing new chroma
* adding expressive marketing ornamentation
* experimental motion behaviours outside §8.5
* introducing new photography styles

---

## 8.3 Visual Rhythm and Spacing Rules

Transcrypt’s layout system is built on a strict, token-driven spacing scheme.
Nothing in the interface — from page-level sections to inline UI elements — may introduce spacing that is not represented in **Appendix B — Spacing Tokens and Specifications**. This ensures:

* predictable rhythm across product, marketing, and documentation
* deterministic behaviour under responsive layouts
* effortless maintainability
* zero spacing drift over time

The entire rhythm of the system is constructed from integer multiples of the **4px base unit**, expressed through the tokens in §B.1–§B.4.

Spacing is not a creative decision. It is structural engineering.

---

## **8.3.1 Vertical Rhythm**

Vertical rhythm defines how content stacks from top to bottom.
Transcrypt uses a **three-tier rhythm model**, each tier mapped directly to token groups in Appendix B:

1. **Section Rhythm** — large structural breaks
2. **Block Rhythm** — grouping of related content
3. **Element Rhythm** — fine-grained spacing inside components

The rules governing this rhythm are absolute:

### **Section Rhythm**

Large breaks in a layout (major page sections, hero to body, long-form document transitions) must use one of the following tokens from §B.2:

* `--space-section-xl` (120px)
* `--space-section-l`  (96px)
* `--space-section-m`  (72px)
* `--space-section-s`  (56px)

Choosing between them is contextual:

* **XL** — hero → body transitions, top of page
* **L** — major content boundaries, long-form documentation
* **M** — dense product screens, supporting sections
* **S** — minimal structural separation on small surfaces

No other spacing values may be used for section-level breaks.

### **Block Rhythm**

Content blocks (cards, grouped controls, stacked paragraphs, dashboard modules) must use the block tokens defined in §B.3:

* `--space-block-l` (40px)
* `--space-block-m` (32px)
* `--space-block-s` (24px)

Blocks are always spaced **evenly** when stacked.
Mixed or improvised block spacing is prohibited.

### **Element Rhythm**

Fine-grained spacing within a block or component (label→input, icon→text, chip stacks, meta groups) must use element tokens from §B.4:

* `--space-element-l`   (20px)
* `--space-element-m`   (16px)
* `--space-element-s`   (12px)
* `--space-element-xs`  (8px)
* `--space-element-xxs` (4px)

These are the **only** permitted intra-component spacing values.
No uncontrolled values (2px, 6px, 10px, 18px, 28px, etc.) may be introduced.

---

## **8.3.2 Spacing Hierarchy**

The spacing hierarchy defines which class of spacing governs what type of decision.
This prevents teams and future contributors from accidentally using oversized spacing for micro-elements or tiny spacing between large blocks.

The hierarchy is:

### **1. Section spacing outranks all other spacing**

Section tokens always override block or element spacing.
If two large blocks appear adjacent and visually function as separate page sections, section spacing must be used—even if the underlying HTML structure suggests otherwise.

Section spacing also governs:

* top-of-page spacing
* page template boundaries (marketing and product)
* major documentation transitions
* tenant dashboard phase breaks

### **2. Block spacing governs structure inside a section**

Block spacing is used when:

* multiple cards or modules appear inside the same section
* stacked form groups need separation
* paragraphs or content clusters require breathing room
* components are grouped into logical clusters

Block spacing may never be substituted with element spacing, even if a block contains only a single piece of content.

### **3. Element spacing governs micro-relationships**

Element spacing is used when dealing with:

* label + input
* icon + text
* chip stacks
* list item internals
* metadata groupings
* button internals
* row items inside a table cell

Element spacing is the only class of spacing permitted *inside* components.

### **Prohibited Practices**

To prevent drift:

* **No ad-hoc pixel values**
  All spacing must map to a token in Appendix B.

* **No “visual guesswork”**
  Designers and developers must not eyeball spacing. Use tokens.

* **No mixing tier classes**
  Block spacing cannot replace section spacing; element spacing cannot replace block spacing.

* **No negative margins**
  Rhythm must be constructed, not hacked.

---

## **Token Cross-References**

This section is normative **only when interpreted via tokens in Appendix B**:

* Section rhythm → §B.2
* Block rhythm → §B.3
* Element rhythm → §B.4
* Base unit (4px) → §B.1

All responsive layouts, Tailwind configs, and CSS implementations must reference these tokens directly.

---

## 8.4 Brand Pattern Usage

Brand patterns in Transcrypt are not decorative assets. They are structural devices used to reinforce hierarchy, distinguish content zones, and provide subtle visual texture without introducing noise or emotional tone.

Patterns exist to **support layout**, not to express personality. They must never compete with typography, iconography, or the core colour palette. Their role is to provide controlled variation in large, sparse, or data-heavy layouts where pure flat colour becomes visually fatiguing.

Patterns are deterministic: a finite set, a finite set of use cases, and no improvisation.

All patterns are defined as reusable SVG assets stored under:

```
/assets/patterns/
```

Only patterns in this directory are permitted.
No new patterns may be created outside a revision of this section.

---

## **8.4.1 Pattern Library**

Transcrypt’s pattern library is deliberately narrow. Each pattern follows the same system:

* engineered geometry
* monochrome or neutral-only
* low-contrast
* repeatable without seams
* based on grid multiples defined in §8.1
* tokenised colours only (Appendix A)

The provisional pattern catalogue consists of **three** system patterns:

### **A. Micro-Grid (Default Structural Pattern)**

A subtle 2px or 4px dot/cross matrix used to give large hero surfaces or section dividers a faint sense of structure.
Characteristics:

* 4px spacing (aligned with the global spacing unit)
* opacity 4–7% against the base
* never used behind text smaller than 18px
* ideal for: hero surfaces, product chrome, non-interactive containers

### **B. Directional Lines (Flow Pattern)**

A sparse diagonal or orthogonal pattern used to hint at “process”, “flow”, or “progression” in operational contexts like dashboards or evaluation summaries.
Characteristics:

* stroke weight locked to iconography stroke
* pattern angle fixed (45° or 0° only)
* opacity 6–12%
* ideal for: workflow summaries, stage transitions, empty-state screens

### **C. Boundary Rings (Containment Pattern)**

Concentric ultra-soft rings used sparingly to metaphorically reinforce sealed boundaries, tenant isolation, and controlled zones.
Characteristics:

* rings spaced by 16px (4 × spacing unit)
* opacity not exceeding 5%
* drawn from neutral or base palette only
* ideal for: tenant switcher, zone headers, section intros

---

## **8.4.2 Restrictions on Pattern Placement**

Patterns can easily become noise. These restrictions are absolute to maintain Transcrypt’s restraint and engineered tone.

### **1. Never behind body text**

No pattern may appear behind running body copy.
Paragraphs, lists, tables, and documentation text must sit on pure surfaces (`--brand-surface-*` only).

### **2. Never behind interactive elements**

Patterns must not interfere with:

* buttons
* forms
* links
* focus indicators
* state chips
* validation messages

Only pure surfaces maintain maximum clarity.

### **3. Do not stack patterns**

Only **one** pattern layer per visual region.
Pattern-on-pattern is prohibited.

### **4. No colourised patterns**

Patterns must only use:

* neutrals (`--neutral-*`)
* base tones (`--brand-base-*`)
* print-safe equivalents

Cerulean accents may never be used for patterns.

### **5. No edge-to-edge on mobile**

On mobile, patterns must not run full-bleed.
They must respect margins defined in §8.1.2 to avoid clutter and cognitive load.

### **6. Fixed opacity ranges**

Each pattern has a strict opacity envelope:

* Micro-grid: **4–7%**
* Directional lines: **6–12%**
* Boundary rings: **3–5%**

Opacity outside these ranges is prohibited.

### **7. No decorative intent**

Patterns are not artistic devices.
If a pattern does not improve **structure, hierarchy, or comprehension**, it is not used.

### **8. Marketing exception rules**

Marketing surfaces may use patterns more expressively **only** when:

* opacity remains within system bounds
* colour remains tokenised
* pattern is one of the three approved forms
* emphasis does not overshadow the logo or primary CTA

No new “marketing patterns” exist outside this library.

---

## 8.5 Motion & Interaction Identity

Motion in Transcrypt is a **behavioural constraint**, not a decorative layer.
It exists to:

* clarify cause and effect
* make state changes legible
* reduce surprise and cognitive noise

It must never:

* perform “delight”
* add personality
* compete with content

All motion is implemented through a **small, fixed set of Tailwind motion tokens** and class combinations. Anything outside that set is considered off-brand.

Transcrypt distinguishes explicitly between:

* **Product surfaces** – Essentials app, in-product flows, dashboards, PDFs, operational UIs.
* **Marketing surfaces** – website, landing pages, campaigns, long-form articles.

Marketing may use a **slightly richer** motion palette, but it remains low-key, deterministic, and free from theatrics. Product motion is stricter and always functional.

---

### 8.5.1 Motion Principles

All motion decisions, whether in the app or marketing, must follow these principles.

1. **Function, not decoration**

   Motion must only exist where it:

   * connects an action to a response (e.g. button press → panel opens)
   * confirms a state change (e.g. filter applied, item saved)
   * helps the eye track content (e.g. accordion expand/collapse)

   If removing the animation does not harm understanding, it is probably not needed.

2. **Calm and minimal**

   Motion is subtle and short:

   * no bouncing, wobbling, springing, or elastic movement
   * no overshoot or “playful” easing
   * no constant motion purely to keep a page “lively”

   Motion should be barely noticeable when things work correctly.

3. **Deterministic and consistent**

   Motion must:

   * start and end in predictable places
   * use the same durations and easings for the same pattern everywhere
   * never vary randomly or based on user profile

   A button behaves the same way on every page, in every environment.

4. **Accessible by default**

   * Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
   * When reduced motion is requested, all non-essential animation must drop to simple **opacity** or **colour** transitions or be disabled entirely.
   * No keyframe-driven movement is allowed in reduced-motion mode.

5. **Hierarchy of importance**

   * Structural changes (modals, drawers, major panel shifts) may use slightly longer durations.
   * Micro-interactions (hover, focus, pressed states) use shortest durations.
   * Marketing hero transitions may use the upper end of the allowed range but must remain restrained.

6. **Tailwind as the motion surface**

   Motion is expressed in Tailwind as:

   * a **small semantic set of “motion tokens”** (documented below), and
   * combinations of `transition-*`, `duration-*`, `ease-*`, and `animate-*` utilities.

   Any class outside that approved set is considered an exception and must be justified and reviewed.

---

### 8.5.2 Easing, Duration, and Behaviour Rules

Motion in Transcrypt is constrained to a **small, semantic set of timings and easings**, implemented via Tailwind.

#### 8.5.2.1 Duration Tokens

Use **three** duration levels, mapped to Tailwind utility classes:

* **`motion-fast`** – micro transitions

  * **Product & marketing:** `duration-150`
  * Use for: hover, focus, pressed states, small colour/opacity shifts.

* **`motion-standard`** – most UI transitions

  * **Product:** `duration-200`
  * **Marketing:** `duration-200` or `duration-300` (for slightly richer hero or section transitions)
  * Use for: dropdowns, accordions, tabs, small layout shifts.

* **`motion-slow`** – structural changes only

  * **Product:** `duration-300`
  * **Marketing:** `duration-300`–`duration-500` (only for hero sections or large view transitions)
  * Use for: modals, page-section fades, overlay entry/exit.

Hard limits:

* No animation longer than **500ms** on any surface.
* No chained, multi-step animations that keep the UI “busy”.
* No infinite loops on product surfaces, ever.

When in doubt, pick **`motion-standard`**.

#### 8.5.2.2 Easing Tokens

Use **two** easing profiles, implemented via Tailwind timing utilities:

* **`motion-ease-standard`** – default interaction easing

  * Tailwind: `ease-out`
  * Use for: most transitions (buttons, panels, drawers, overlays).
  * Behaviour: quick start, smooth deceleration, no overshoot.

* **`motion-ease-subtle`** – softer motion for background elements

  * Tailwind: `ease-in-out`
  * Use for: marketing hero fades, section reveals, background content moves.
  * Behaviour: gentle in/out, still short and controlled.

All UI motion must use `ease-out` or `ease-in-out`.
`ease-in` and `linear` are reserved for very specific internal uses (e.g. stealth progress indicators) and should be considered exceptions.

Prohibited easings:

* custom cubic-bezier curves that overshoot or bounce
* spring/physics driven easings in production UIs
* anything that looks like “elastic”, “back”, or “bounce”

#### 8.5.2.3 Transition Properties

Only the following properties may be animated in normal use, expressed via Tailwind:

* **Colour and background:**

  * `transition-colors` with `duration-150/200` and `ease-out`
  * Use for: hover, focus, active states, state chips.

* **Opacity:**

  * `transition-opacity` with `duration-150/200/300` and `ease-out`
  * Use for: fades, loading placeholders, simple reveals.

* **Transform (very limited):**

  * `transition-transform` with `duration-150/200` and `ease-out`
  * Permitted transforms: small `translate-y` or `scale` for menus, drawers, modals.
  * Max translation: `translate-y-2` (8px).
  * Max scale range: 0.98 → 1.0 or 1.0 → 1.02, no more.

* **Height for controlled panels:**

  * Use only for accordion / expand-collapse patterns, with care to avoid jank.
  * If it causes layout instability, switch to opacity instead.

Any animation outside colours, opacity, and small transforms must be treated as an exception and justified in writing.

---

### 8.5.3 Interaction Feedback Standards

Interaction feedback is how the system confirms that an input was registered and a state transition is happening.

#### 8.5.3.1 Product Surfaces

In the Essentials app and any operational UI:

* **Hover** (desktop):

  * Use `transition-colors duration-150 ease-out`.
  * Allowed changes: background, border, text colour, subtle shadow.
  * No movement, no scale, no “lift” beyond a very small shadow change.

* **Focus**:

  * Must always be visually clear.
  * Implement with a focus ring using colour tokens and `transition-shadow` if needed.
  * Never rely solely on colour; shape/outline should also indicate focus.

* **Pressed / Active**:

  * Use a short `motion-fast` duration, slight darkening/brightening or tiny scale (e.g. `scale-95`) with `ease-out`.
  * No long “button down” states, no bounce on release.

* **Toggles, switches, and checkboxes**:

  * Animate only the internal knob or fill state with `duration-150/200`, `ease-out`.
  * Avoid large sliding distances or slow state changes.

* **Modals, drawers, overlays**:

  * Fade and/or small vertical translation using `motion-standard` or `motion-slow`.
  * Background dimmer uses `transition-opacity`.
  * No zoom-in/zoom-out theatrics.

* **Loading indicators**:

  * Use either:

    * static indicators (spinners/progress bars) with `animate-[spin]` or
    * very subtle pulse aligned to `motion-standard`.
  * No bouncing dots, wave loaders, or character animations.

#### 8.5.3.2 Marketing Surfaces

On the marketing site and landing pages:

* **Section reveals**:

  * Allowed: soft opacity + small translate (e.g. `opacity-0 → opacity-100`, `translate-y-4 → translate-y-0`) with `duration-300`–`duration-500`, `ease-in-out`.
  * Triggered on initial load or once on scroll into view. No repeating scroll parallax.

* **Hero motion**:

  * Allowed: slow background shifts, mild fades, or small icon motion.
  * No parallax that fights with content or causes motion sickness.

* **Illustrative loops**:

  * Allowed: restrained Lottie or SVG loops that:

    * do not flash
    * do not jitter
    * do not spin continuously in a distracting way
  * Must pause or reduce when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set.

Even on marketing surfaces, motion must never overshadow content.

#### 8.5.3.3 Tailwind Motion Tokens in Practice

In code, motion standards translate into Tailwind utility combinations such as:

* Product micro-interaction:

  * `transition-colors duration-150 ease-out`
* Product modal:

  * `transition-opacity transition-transform duration-200 ease-out`
* Marketing hero:

  * `transition-opacity duration-500 ease-in-out`

Developers must reuse these patterns rather than inventing new combinations ad hoc.

---

### 8.5.4 Prohibited Motion

The following motion patterns are **explicitly banned** across all Transcrypt surfaces, regardless of context.

1. **Tailwind’s expressive animation utilities**

   Prohibited in production:

   * `animate-bounce`
   * `animate-ping`
   * `animate-pulse` (except for a very controlled, reduced-motion aware indicator)
   * `animate-spin` on anything decorative
   * any custom animation with similar behaviour

   Spin is allowed only for functional spinners, at modest speed.

2. **High-energy or playful motion**

   * Bouncing, wobbling, squashing, stretching
   * Elastic or spring-back effects
   * “Card lift” that jumps by more than 8px or scales by more than 2%
   * “Hover jump” interactions that move content significantly

3. **Infinite decorative loops**

   * Background animations that never stop
   * Continuous colour cycling
   * Looping shape morphs with no functional meaning

   Exceptions: a subtle, low-energy loop in a hero illustration, provided it is calm, slow, and respects reduced-motion preferences.

4. **Motion as reward or celebration**

   * Confetti, fireworks, bursts, “success” explosions
   * Tick marks that bounce or “celebrate”
   * Animated badges or trophies

   Success is confirmed by concise copy and clear state, not theatrics.

5. **Motion that obstructs reading**

   * Animations that move behind or under text
   * Parallax that causes text and backgrounds to move in opposing directions
   * Repeated in-view reveals while the user scrolls back and forth

6. **Large-scale layout reflow animations**

   * Animating entire page layouts on every navigation
   * Sliding whole pages left/right/up/down as if on a carousel
   * Long morphs between radically different layouts

7. **Non-compliant reduced-motion behaviour**

   * Ignoring `prefers-reduced-motion`
   * Using the same animation but slightly slower instead of simplifying it
   * Keeping constant subtle motion even when reduced motion is requested

   When reduced motion is set, only essential transitions (opacity/colour) should remain.

8. **Unapproved custom keyframes**

   Any `@keyframes` or custom Tailwind animation config that:

   * rotates, bounces, or shakes elements
   * flashes colours
   * moves elements more than 8px repeatedly
   * runs longer than 500ms in a loop

   must be treated as non-compliant unless explicitly documented and approved.

---

## 8.6 Audio & Sonic Identity

Transcrypt is fundamentally a **quiet system**.
Silence is part of its identity — calm, deliberate, engineered.
Audio is therefore treated as a **high-risk medium**: permitted only when it improves comprehension or accessibility, and forbidden everywhere it introduces personality, theatrics, or emotional colouration.

On product surfaces, the default is **no audio at all**.
On marketing surfaces, audio is allowed only when the user explicitly triggers it (e.g., a video).
System-generated sound must never play automatically.

This section defines **when audio is allowed, when it is prohibited, and what its tone must be when it is used**.

---

## **8.6.1 When Audio Is Allowed**

Audio is permitted only in three narrow contexts:

### **1. User-initiated video content (marketing only)**

If a user actively presses “play”, audio may accompany:

* product walkthrough videos
* founder/engineering commentary
* promotional explainers
* demo recordings

Even then, the soundtrack must be clean, minimal, and free of “tech-fantasy” tropes.

### **2. Accessibility-driven cues (product only)**

Audio may assist users who rely on:

* screen readers
* audible status confirmations
* system alerts required for accessibility compliance

These must follow platform standards — never custom-designed sounds.

### **3. Explicit opt-in notifications (rare)**

A user may configure an optional, explicit setting (off by default) for:

* long-running evaluation completion
* audit export readiness
* tenant-level lifecycle events

These audio cues must be:

* extremely short (under 400ms)
* neutral in tone
* not melodic

If the user has not opted in, audio must not play under any circumstances.

---

## **8.6.2 Default Prohibition Rules**

Audio is **prohibited by default** on all Transcrypt surfaces unless it fits one of the three categories above.

Specifically forbidden:

* **Auto-playing sound** of any kind
* **UI bleeps**, pings, click sounds, or confirmation tones
* **Hover or focus sound effects**
* **Success/celebration sounds**
* **Error buzzers**, warning tones, or failure stingers
* **Marketing auto-loops**
* **Ambient soundbeds** on landing pages
* **Musical branding**, jingles, or mnemonic signature tones
* **Keyboard emulation sounds** in code or terminal demos
* **Audio metaphors** (e.g., lock sounds, paper shuffling, modem tones)

Transcrypt does not gamify security, and it does not dramatise operations.
The absence of sound is intentional.

---

## **8.6.3 Tone and Behaviour Requirements**

When audio is used (rarely), it must follow strict behavioural and tonal constraints.

### **Tone Requirements**

Audio must be:

* neutral
* precise
* non-melodic
* low-frequency dominant
* free of cinematic effects
* free of reverb, echo, distortion, or modulation

Think *instrument panel*, not *marketing flourish*.

No musical intervals, no chord progressions, no earworms, no personality.

### **Behaviour Requirements**

* Must respect **system volume settings**
* Must respect **browser autoplay blocking**
* Must respect **prefers-reduced-motion and accessibility preferences**
* Must never **layer sounds** or play multiple cues simultaneously
* Must **never loop indefinitely**

Audio must always behave predictably and silently exit when disabled.

---

## **8.6.4 Third-Party / Partner Restrictions**

Third-party or partner content embedded within Transcrypt surfaces (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, webinar embeds) must follow these restrictions:

### **1. No auto-play**

All embedded players must load in a muted state until the user presses play.

### **2. No unvetted audio tracks**

If a partner’s audio includes:

* aggressive music
* speculative tech sounds
* high-energy marketing tracks
* emotional or manipulative scoring

…the embed must be rejected, replaced, or disabled.

### **3. No interactive audio elements**

No external widgets may introduce:

* sound-on-hover
* sound-on-scroll
* ambient loops
* background animations with audio

### **4. Compliance with browser and platform rules**

Any embedded player must respect:

* autoplay policies
* mobile OS restrictions
* corporate lockdown environments
* reduced-motion or accessibility settings

If compliance cannot be guaranteed, the audio must be stripped or the embed must be removed entirely.

---

## 8.7 Wireframes and Structural Examples

Wireframes visualise Transcrypt’s structural logic without the distraction of colour, typography, or imagery. They are functional blueprints — tools for communicating layout rhythm, information hierarchy, spacing, and behavioural patterns before visual styling is applied.
They exist to ensure that every surface designed under the Transcrypt brand inherits the same clarity, calmness, and predictable flow defined in the PDS and reinforced by this guide.

Wireframes are **not** creative artefacts.
They are structural evidence of adherence to the system.

### **8.7.1 Purpose of Wireframes**

Wireframes serve as the intermediate layer between layout rules (Section 8.1–8.4) and real-world marketing or application surfaces (Section 9). Their purpose is to:

* Validate the spatial grid in real contexts
* Test information hierarchy before visual styling
* Expose layout issues early (density, imbalance, cognitive weight)
* Demonstrate correct use of spacing, rhythm, and block composition
* Provide partners and contractors with an unambiguous structural template

Every significant layout — page templates, dashboards, forms, modals, onboarding flows — must be wireframed before typography, colour, or imagery is applied.

### **8.7.2 Core Layout Wireframes**

Core layout wireframes illustrate the structural backbone of the brand. Every layout must obey:

* **Consistent grid usage:** 12-column default, with documented breakpoints
* **Predictable spacing:** following the fixed or modular scale defined in Section 8.3
* **Clean hierarchy:** one dominant H1 block, clear secondary blocks, and grouped tertiary elements
* **No visual noise:** whitespace is an active structural component, not an optional one

Core wireframes must be produced for:

* **Homepage framework** (hero zone, clarity block, CTA structure)
* **Content pages** (blog/article layouts)
* **Feature or landing pages**
* **Documentation-style layouts**
* **Dashboard or app pages** where relevant

Each wireframe shows *structure only* — boxes, labels, spacing, and flow.

### **8.7.3 Form and Flow Wireframes**

Forms and workflows have strict structural requirements due to Transcrypt’s purpose: reduce cognitive load and eliminate ambiguity.

Wireframes must demonstrate:

* **Single-column form layouts** for readability and clarity
* **Clear field grouping** using spacing, not borders
* **Minimal branching** in any given interaction
* **Predictable CTA placement:** right-aligned primary, left or centre secondary
* **Inline validation areas** that preserve rhythm and do not shift the layout erratically

Flow wireframes must include:

* **Step-by-step task flows**
* **Verification or review steps**
* **Progress indicators**
* **Error and fallback states**

These wireframes define behaviour and guidance long before visuals appear.

### **8.7.4 Do and Don’t Wireframe Patterns**

Wireframes must make acceptable and unacceptable patterns explicit.

**Acceptable:**

* Generous spacing
* Calm rhythm with minimal visual density
* One visual focus per screen
* Predictable alignment of elements
* Clear, unambiguous reading paths

**Forbidden:**

* Crowded layouts
* Overuse of columns (no multi-column forms)
* Excessive grouping lines or boxed sections
* Surprise elements (pop-ins, floating blocks, disconnected CTAs)
* Visually aggressive structures (tight density, inconsistent block widths)

Wireframes act as the inspection mechanism: if a layout doesn't wireframe cleanly, it will not behave cleanly once styled.

---

## **8.8 State and Mode Patterns**

State and mode patterns define how Transcrypt behaves in every non-ideal or transitional situation. These states carry significant brand weight: they influence user trust more than static surfaces. They must be calm, unambiguous, structured, and free of theatrics.
Every loading sequence, error message, success confirmation, or empty pattern must follow the same predictable rules to preserve the brand’s promise of clarity and confidence.

No state may introduce surprise, motion spikes, playful language, or unnecessary visual noise.

### **8.8.1 Loading States**

Loading patterns must:

* Use **minimal, low-motion indicators**
* Preserve layout structure; no content “jumping”
* Avoid skeleton screens unless the structural layout requires them
* Use neutral language: *“Loading…”*, *“Preparing view…”*
* Never use humour, filler text, or animations with character or personality

Loading indicators must not distract or imply instability.
No pulsing colour, no playful metaphors, no progress bars unless time is genuinely meaningful.

### **8.8.2 Empty States**

Empty states exist to reduce uncertainty. They must:

* Clearly state why the space is empty
* Provide one primary next action (e.g., “Add evidence”)
* Use short, directive copy
* Include a small visual indicator *only if it reinforces clarity*

Empty states must not use:

* Metaphors
* Illustrations implying emotion
* Humorous or “light” tone
* Decorative visuals

The intention is calm instruction, not engagement or entertainment.

### **8.8.3 Validation and Error States**

Error states must be clinical, factual, and free from dramatics.

Rules:

* Use **precise, actionable language**: *“This field is required.”*, *“Invalid email format.”*
* Avoid blame, personality, humour, or conversational flourishes
* Highlight only the affected element — no full-screen error patterns unless the system is genuinely unavailable
* Never animate errors; no shaking, bouncing, pulsing, or colour flashes

Colour use must follow Section 4.5 (Prohibited Applications):
Errors must meet WCAG; no high-saturation reds or flashing affordances.

### **8.8.4 Success and Confirmation States**

Success feedback must:

* Be minimal and brief
* Use clean, neutral confirmation: *“Saved.”*, *“Completed.”*
* Avoid celebratory icons, emojis, confetti, ticks with flourish, or bright colour flashes
* Maintain layout stability; do not shift the interface unnecessarily

Transcrypt does not do “congratulations,” “you’re all set!”, or any copy implying personality or emotional performance.

### **8.8.5 Pending, Review, and Intermediate States**

These states occur when work is in progress but not yet complete—especially relevant to compliance workflows.

Rules:

* Use precise descriptors: *“Pending review”*, *“Awaiting confirmation”*, *“In progress”*
* No metaphors about “journeys,” “paths,” or “processing magic”
* Maintain stable structure; avoid intermediate animations

If a user must wait for back-end operations, fallback messages must be clear and deterministic.

### **8.8.6 System-Level Error Modes**

For outages, integration failures, or major exceptions:

* Use structured, audit-aligned messaging
* Avoid blaming language or conversational tone
* Provide one clear fallback path
* Include an incident identifier for support

No humour, no brand personality, no flourish.
System errors represent reputational risk and must reinforce calm professionalism.

### **8.8.7 Interaction Modes**

Interaction modes define how users move through tasks:

* Focus states must be visible, WCAG-compliant, and restrained
* Hover states (desktop) must be minimal and avoid colour jumps
* Disabled states must be clearly distinguishable
* Active states must rely on structural cues, not strong colour

Modes must never introduce:

* Glow effects
* Neon accents
* Animated highlights
* Playful feedback

The product must remain calm at all times.

### **8.8.8 Fallback and No-JS States**

If JavaScript is disabled or fails:

* Primary content must remain readable
* Critical actions must degrade gracefully
* Errors must follow the same tone and structural rules

No fallback may present a broken or partially styled identity.

---

# 9. Marketing Application

Marketing surfaces are the places where Transcrypt must speak clearly, attract attention, and convert interest into action without compromising the engineered seriousness of the core identity. Unlike product UI — which is governed by strict behavioural constraints and low-amplitude visual rules — marketing surfaces operate in noisier, competitive environments and require a broader expressive range. This section defines that range.

Marketing is not a relaxation of the system. It is an extension of it.
Every visual and verbal decision must still reflect the principles defined in Sections 1–8: clarity, restraint, determinism, and structural consistency. But within those boundaries, marketing may leverage modern techniques — layout dynamism, controlled motion, persuasive hierarchy, and sharper visual contrast — to meet the demands of public communication.

This section specifies how the brand behaves across the website, social channels, presentations, and physical materials. It defines the rules for:

layout frameworks and safe zones

motion and emphasis calibrated for public surfaces

photography and imagery under marketing constraints

colour balance and accent usage appropriate for high-competition environments

typography rules adapted for larger, more expressive surfaces

cross-format consistency across web, social, presentation, and print

Marketing surfaces must be recognisably Transcrypt: engineered, precise, calm.
They must also be competitive, modern, and instantly readable in crowded spaces.

The following subsections define the structural, typographic, and behavioural system that enables both.

## 9.1 Website Brand Usage

The website is the primary public expression of Transcrypt. It must reflect the engineered discipline of the product while using a more dynamic, persuasive communication style appropriate for marketing contexts. Layouts may be more expressive, motion may be more prominent, and imagery may be richer — but the underlying system must remain recognisable: deterministic structure, clear hierarchy, cold palette discipline, and consistency with the logo, typography, and spacing rules defined earlier.

The website must feel like a clean, confident, technically grounded platform — not a glossy SaaS theme.
Every element must reinforce clarity, trust, and structural calm, even when executing attention-driven marketing patterns.

---

### **9.1.1 Homepage Rules**

The homepage is a controlled high-impact environment. It is the only surface where you may use maximal contrast, tighter headlines, stronger visual rhythm, and more assertive accent usage — but still within the deterministic brand constraints.

**Rules**

1. **Hero Zone Structure**

   * One clear primary tagline (from §2.4.1).
   * One supporting sentence — factual, non-emotive.
   * One primary CTA using `--accent-500`.
   * Optional secondary CTA with neutral styling.
   * No decorative gradients or chromatic backgrounds (only engineered base or light surface blocks).

2. **Logo Usage**

   * Only the PRIMARY lockup may be used in the hero zone.
   * No compact mark substitutions.
   * No colour deviation.

3. **Layout & Spacing**

   * Uses the full 12-column grid.
   * Left-aligned content for desktop; centred for mobile.
   * 4× spacing unit enforced (per §8.3).

4. **Photography & Illustration**

   * Must follow §7 rules: documentary or abstract-technical only.
   * No AI-fantasy imagery, no “people pointing at laptops,” no staged happiness.
   * Light motion (parallax, fade, slide) permitted within limits defined in §8.5.

5. **Accent Usage**

   * Accent may be used as:

     * CTA
     * interactive focus
     * small vector elements
   * Must **never** be used as a background block.

6. **Homepage Sections**
   Required pattern structure:

   * Clarity block (what Transcrypt is)
   * Proof block (how it works, factual)
   * Feature block (3-column pattern)
   * Social proof / context (if available)
   * CTA footer block

7. **No Marketing Gloss**

   * Expressive but not theatrical.
   * No inflated claims, no transformation metaphors, no hype-adjectives.
   * Motion must be subtle; no loud scroll hijacks or aggressive reveals.

---

### **9.1.2 Blog and Article Styling**

Blog articles and long-form content must be treated as technical writing, not marketing copy. They sit closer to the behaviour of the product and must adopt the structured, disciplined identity of Transcrypt.

**Rules**

1. **Typography**

   * Headings: IBM Plex Sans, weights per §5.2.1.
   * Body: IBM Plex Sans regular (400).
   * Code blocks: IBM Plex Mono (400).
   * No italics, no decorative emphasis.

2. **Layout & Grids**

   * Single-column width for readability.
   * Maximum line width of 72–80 characters.
   * Consistent 4× spacing unit.

3. **Images & Diagrams**

   * Must follow §7 photography rules and §6 illustration rules.
   * No stock marketing imagery.
   * Only:

     * diagrams
     * neutral photography
     * screenshots
     * architecture visuals
   * Diagrams must use the colour constraints of §4.4.

4. **Tone of Voice**

   * Must follow the Tone rules in §2.2.
   * Factual, literal, calm.
   * No conversational framing.
   * No storytelling flourishes.

5. **Accent Usage**

   * Only for hyperlinks or inline emphasis.
   * Never for headings or large blocks.

6. **Metadata & Tags**

   * Must use neutral colours (`--neutral-600` / `--neutral-500`).
   * No “pill” badges with bright colour.

7. **Pull Quotes**

   * Optional.
   * Must be neutral and typographically restrained — not stylised or emotional.
   * No giant decorative quotation marks or oversized contrast blocks.

8. **Tables, Lists, Blockquotes**

   * Must adopt the same rhythm rules as documentation (PDS §11).
   * No alternate formatting for “style.”

Blog posts must read like they come from a technical founder — precise, calm, structured — not a marketing intern chasing engagement.

---

## 9.2 Social Media Templates

Transcrypt’s social channels are *extensions of the brand system*, not separate “lighter” identities.
They are allowed **more motion, stronger contrast, and tighter layout**, but the voice remains calm, factual, and engineered. No emotional tone, no hype, no memes, no “brand personality.”
Everything must still look like it comes from a cybersecurity platform built by a systems engineer — not a marketing department performing trends.

This section defines **structural templates**, **layout constraints**, and **behaviour rules** for posts, stories, reels, and any future short-form channels.

---

### **9.2.1 Post Layouts**

Posts must communicate clearly at a glance, using the same visual discipline as the website:

#### **1. Core Layout Structure**

All static posts follow a fixed structure:

1. **Top band (optional)**
   Neutral background (`--brand-surface-0` or `--neutral-100`).
   Used sparingly to introduce tight, factual headings.
   No accent background.

2. **Primary content zone**
   One core idea per post.
   Uses the 4× spacing unit.
   Text must be minimal, high-contrast, and skimmable.

3. **Footer zone (optional)**
   Tiny Transcrypt monogram (compact variant), right-aligned.
   No URL, no slogans.

#### **2. Typography**

* IBM Plex Sans only.
* Headings: 600 weight, no italics.
* Body: 400.
* Mono text allowed for technical snippets (IDs, hashes).
* No decorative typography or stylised lettering.

#### **3. Backgrounds**

* Default: `--brand-surface-0` (white) or `--brand-base-900` (engineered base).
* Accent backgrounds strictly forbidden.
* No gradients, gloss, duotone, neon, or “SaaS blue fade” visuals.

#### **4. Use of Accent**

Accent (`--accent-500`) allowed for:

* diagrams
* arrows
* highlights of key phrases
* data callouts
* icons

Never for background blocks or splash colours.

#### **5. Photography**

If used:

* must follow §7 rules
* documentary, restrained, technical
* never emotional, friendly, or stock-style
* no models, no staged work scenes, no “team brainstorming” nonsense

#### **6. Motion (for animated posts)**

Animations must follow §8.5:

* minimal
* low amplitude
* linear or ease-out
* no bounce
* no elastic or playful transitions
* no jump cuts or flashy sequences

---

### **9.2.2 Story and Reel Templates**

Stories and reels (LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, future channels) must convey clarity and competence in short bursts without adopting social-native theatrics.
They may move faster than product surfaces — but not become expressive or emotional.

#### **1. Core Principles**

* No humour, no performative positivity.
* Messaging must be literal: “How to handle evidence expiry,” “CE requirements explained,” “Why sealed tenancy matters.”
* Motion must be **simple**, **linear**, and **structural**, not cinematic.

#### **2. Story Structure (vertical format)**

Stories follow a strict set of templates:

##### **Template A: Statement → Proof**

1. Statement (large, structural, IBM Plex Sans, centre or left aligned)
2. Neutral diagram or visual token
3. One-line factual explanation

##### **Template B: Step-by-Step**

1. Title (“How Transcrypt handles X”)
2. Step 1 block
3. Step 2 block
4. Step 3 block
5. CTA (“Read more on the site”)

##### **Template C: Diagram First**

1. Cerulean-highlighted diagram (light usage)
2. One-sentence explainer
3. CTA or conclusion

#### **3. Reel Structure (short video)**

Duration: 5–20 seconds.

Permitted elements:

* direct text-over-background
* muted motion graphics
* scrolling diagrams
* code-style overlays
* architectural diagrams
* animated lists or callouts
* cursor-like guided attention (but minimal)

Forbidden:

* talking-heads
* emotional voiceovers
* hype edits
* enthusiastic narration
* sparkle/glint effects
* stock B-roll of offices, hands typing, “team collaboration” scenes

#### **4. Audio**

* Neutral synthetic tones only
* No upbeat music
* No emotional cues
* No corporate jingle
* Transitions must be barely noticeable

#### **5. Branding**

* Compact monogram only
* Placed in a consistent corner
* Never animated independently of the content
* Never displayed large or as a “brand takeover” frame

---

### **Summary of 9.2 Rules**

*Structure = engineered.
Tone = calm.
Motion = minimal.
Colour = identity-hierarchy only.
Purpose = clarity, not personality.*

This delivers a social presence that is recognisable, disciplined, and visually consistent with all upstream constraints — while still allowing modern, effective marketing execution.

---

## 9.3 Slide Deck and Presentation Style

Transcrypt’s presentation system mirrors the product’s identity: engineered, calm, factual, and structurally disciplined.
Slide decks are not a marketing playground — they are an extension of the same deterministic system expressed in the PRD, SAIS, PDS, and the rest of this guide.
They must feel like documentation rendered at presentation scale: predictable grids, controlled rhythm, no theatrics, no “conference gloss.”

Decks must communicate authority and clarity without emotional tone, enthusiasm, or salesmanship. They must avoid the traditional SaaS pitch-deck visual tropes completely.

---

### **9.3.1 Master Slides**

Master slides establish the invariant skeleton from which all decks are built.
They are strict, minimal, and highly structured.

#### **1. Title Slide (Primary)**

Elements:

* Background: `--brand-base-900` (deep engineered base).
* Monogram: centred or top-left at fixed scale.
* Wordmark: directly below or to the right depending on lockup.
* Title block: left-aligned; large IBM Plex Sans 600.
* Subtitle: IBM Plex Sans 400 in `--neutral-300` or `--neutral-400`.
* No gradients, no hero photography, no illustration overlays.

Use cases: public talks, investor updates, audit-facing presentations, internal briefings.

#### **2. Section Divider Slide**

Purpose: resetting cognitive frame without theatrics.

Rules:

* Background: either `--brand-base-800` or `--brand-surface-0`.
* One clear heading (H1).
* Optional micro filigree detail using `--filigree-violet-*` tokens (single thin line, small grid dot array).
* No secondary text except a short descriptor.
* No icons, no diagrams, no CTAs.

#### **3. Content Slide (Primary Layout)**

The default presentation slide.

* Grid: 12-column layout with 64px side gutters.
* Title: H2 (IBM Plex Sans 600).
* Body: IBM Plex Sans 400 at comfortable reading size.
* Visual: one diagram, table, or bullet group — never all at once.
* Spacing: strict multiples of 8px (as per §8.3).
* No decorative shapes or background colours.

#### **4. Diagram-First Slide**

Used for SAIS/PDS-style explanations.

* Diagram occupies 60–75% of slide.
* Title and short description sit above or beside.
* All diagram colours must use neutrals or cerulean (`--accent-500`) for emphasis.
* Semantic colours allowed only if showing system state.

No cinematic motion, no animated builds, no flourish transitions.

#### **5. List/Process Slide**

For structured sequences or operational logic.

Rules:

* Maximum 5 items.
* Each item uses IBM Plex Sans 500 for title, 400 for body.
* Optional icons must follow §6 Feather rules.
* No numbering styles that imply personality (circles, gradients, oversized digits).

#### **6. End Slide**

Purpose: closure, not cheerfulness.

* Either brand-base dark background or light surface.
* Monogram only.
* One line of text: factual, not warm (“Contact” or “Resources”).
* No “thank you,” no exclamation marks, no handshake sentiment.

---

### **9.3.2 Typography and Colour Rules**

Typography and colour in slide decks must behave identically to all other brand surfaces — with minor scaling allowances due to viewing distance.

#### **Typography Rules**

**Font family**

* IBM Plex Sans — exclusive for all narrative content.
* IBM Plex Mono — only for code, IDs, or technical snippets.

**Weights**

* Titles: 600
* Subtitles / labels: 500
* Body: 400
* Mono: 400

**Absolute prohibitions**

* No italics
* No condensed/expanded variants
* No drop shadows or outlines
* No decorative typography
* No smart quotes in titles
* No emoji or expressive punctuation

**Sizes**
Relative scaling must follow a predictable ratio:

* Title → 1.35× body
* Subtitle → 1.15× body
* Body → baseline
* Meta → 0.9× body

This ratio ensures rhythm and avoids “pitch-deck drama.”

---

#### **Colour Rules**

Slides use the **primary palette only**, with neutrals for structure.
No secondary accents unless communicating system state.

**Background options**

* `--brand-base-900`
* `--brand-base-800`
* `--brand-surface-0`
* `--brand-surface-50`

Nothing else.

**Text colours**

* On light surfaces → `--neutral-900` for primary, `--neutral-700`/`--neutral-600` for meta.
* On dark surfaces → `--white` or `--neutral-50`, with `--neutral-300` for meta.

**Accent usage**
Accent (`--accent-500`) permitted only for:

* diagram emphasis
* arrows
* interactive callouts
* highlighting a constraint or architecture element

Accent is **not** used for headings, backgrounds, or large shapes.

**Filigree usage**
Subtle filigree violet tokens (`--filigree-violet-*`) allowed only for:

* micro dividers
* folio marks
* section-frame ornamentation

Never used for text or diagrams.

**Forbidden colour behaviours**

* Gradients
* Background accent blocks
* High-saturation semantic colours
* Decorative duotones
* Overlays and photographic colour treatments

Slides must feel architectural, not promotional.

---

## 9.4 Print and Physical Media

Print surfaces are the most unforgiving expression of the Transcrypt identity.
There is no animation, no interactivity, no dynamic layout correction — only fixed geometry, ink behaviour, paper texture, and real-world lighting.
Because print removes all digital affordances, it becomes a stress-test of the brand system’s structural integrity.

Transcrypt’s print identity must therefore follow **the same deterministic rules** used across the web, app, diagrams, and PDFs — but with stricter constraints on colour fidelity, spacing, logo usage, and typographic clarity.

Print assets must read as:

* engineered
* neutral
* calm
* audit-compatible
* technically precise
* completely free of advertising gloss

Noise, flourish, and expressive styling are prohibited.

The subsections below define the correct treatment for business cards, event materials, posters, banners, and signage.

---

### **9.4.1 Business Cards**

Business cards are compact physical identifiers and must express the brand’s neutrality and discipline even at small scale.

#### **Layout Rules**

* Grid: 12-column system reduced proportionally to card dimensions.
* Margins: minimum 6mm on all sides.
* Logo: monogram-only or primary lockup, depending on layout.
* Orientation: horizontal preferred; vertical allowed only for technical roles.
* Spacing: all elements must align to the spacing scale defined in §8.3 (multiples of 8px → converted to mm).

#### **Typography**

* Typeface: IBM Plex Sans only.
* Size: never below 7.5pt for any text.
* Weights:

  * Name → 600
  * Title → 500
  * Contact details → 400
  * No italics, no condensed, no decorative edits.

#### **Colour**

* Background options:

  * `--brand-surface-0` (light)
  * `--brand-base-900` (dark)

* Text:

  * On light → `--neutral-900`
  * On dark → `--white`

* Accent (`--accent-500`): allowed only for:

  * a single hairline rule
  * micro emphasis
  * QR code callout (optional)

* Filigree violet allowed for micro-detailing only, never text.

#### **Information Block**

Must include:

* Name
* Role
* Email
* URL
* Optional QR code to website

No slogans, no taglines, no social icons (unless absolutely required by context).

---

### **9.4.2 Posters, Banners, and Signage**

Large-format identity must scale deterministically. No reinterpretation, no dramatic colour blends, no inspirational poster energy.

#### **General Principles**

* Use the same grid proportions defined in §8.1, scaled up.
* Reserve whitespace aggressively — posters must feel quiet, not crowded.
* Typography must be large, neutral, and factual.
* Logo must use the primary lockup except where extreme compression forces monogram-only.

#### **Typography**

* IBM Plex Sans only.
* Weight: 600 for headlines, 400–500 for supporting text.
* No italics, stylised caps, stretched text, stroked text, or “design-y” tracking expansions.
* Line height: generous, matching the rhythm of §5.4.

#### **Colour**

* Background options:

  * `--brand-base-900`
  * `--brand-base-800`
  * `--brand-surface-0`
  * `--brand-surface-50`

* Accent may be used only as:

  * a single vertical or horizontal structural bar
  * a diagram pointer
  * a CTA indicator (e.g., “Scan QR”)

* No accent backgrounds, no gradients, no colour fields intended to convey emotion.

#### **Imagery**

If included:

* Must follow all of §7 Imagery and Photography.
* No illustrations that carry emotional tone.
* Subject must be operational, documentary, or architectural.
* Cropping must be restrained and geometry-aligned.

#### **Signage-Specific Constraints**

Signage must read at distance and under varied lighting:

* Minimum contrast ratio: high-compliance equivalent of WCAG AAA where feasible.
* Logo must never be lower than 40mm height in print.
* QR codes must be tested at 2–3m distance.
* No decorative patterns beyond the micro pattern library in §8.4.

#### **Event Booth Modules (Future Forward)**

Even though booth design is future work:

* Use large neutral fields, not marketing gradients.
* Primary lockup only.
* No stylised environmental lighting effects.
* Panels must resemble Transcrypt documentation brought to physical scale.

---

## 9.5 Application Examples

Application examples exist to make the rules real.
This section is not decorative; it is operational.
It shows exactly how the Transcrypt identity behaves across real surfaces — and, critically, how it **fails** when misapplied.

The examples in this section are normative.
If a future design choice contradicts an example here, the example wins unless superseded by an explicit versioned update.

The goal: show the boundaries of the system with clarity, finality, and zero interpretive drift.

---

### **9.5.1 Correct Usage Examples**

These examples demonstrate the identity working exactly as intended: calm, engineered, unambiguous.

#### **A. Homepage Hero – Correct**

* Base: `--brand-base-900`
* Typography: IBM Plex Sans, weight 600 for headline
* Accent: used once as a micro indicator or CTA
* No gradients
* Whitespace used aggressively
* Icon: 24×24 Feather, neutral tone, single stroke weight

This composition reads like a technical instrument panel, not a marketing splash.

#### **B. Blog Article – Correct**

* Background: `--brand-surface-0`
* Typography: 18/28 IBM Plex Sans for body
* Neutral greys for hierarchy (`--neutral-700`, `--neutral-500`, `--neutral-400`)
* Accent only for hyperlinks
* No decorative imagery — only documentary or schematic material

Reinforces Transcrypt as a domain authority, not a lifestyle brand.

#### **C. Social Tile – Correct**

* Square layout, neutral background
* Monogram or primary lockup only
* Headline in 600 weight, centre anchored on grid
* Accent used for a single rule or pointer only
* No effects, textures, or stylised cutouts

Outputs as predictable, legible, and platform-agnostic.

#### **D. Presentation Slide – Correct**

* Dark base or light surface
* Title in 600 weight
* Body in 400–500
* No decorative shapes
* Diagram colours pulled only from §A.2 semantic and §A.3 neutral tokens
* Consistent margin discipline

Looks like a documentation layer brought to slide format — not a pitch deck.

---

### **9.5.2 Incorrect Usage Examples**

A non-exhaustive set of patterns that violate the identity and are therefore prohibited.

#### **A. Gradient Backgrounds**

Any gradient, regardless of colour, is prohibited.
No brand colour shifts, no duotone washes, no soft fades.

#### **B. Emotional Colouring**

* Warm “friendly” palettes
* Trendy lilacs, greens, salmons
* High-energy blues or teals
* Instagram aesthetic tones

All are categorically off-brand.

#### **C. Hyper-Expressive Typography**

* Oversized display type
* Condensed grotesks
* Italicised emphasis
* “Design-y” leading or tracking
* Text stacked in expressive arrangements

Typography must remain neutral and functional.

#### **D. Decorative Icons**

* Filled icons
* Shaded icons
* Emoji metaphors
* Non-Feather icon sets
* Hand-drawn emotional styles

Icons exist for clarity, not personality.

#### **E. Over-Marketed Social Tiles**

* Soft-blur backgrounds
* Character-focused photography
* Colour block hype walls
* Inspirational poster vibes

These destroy the engineering-first tone and are not permitted.

---

### **9.5.3 Extended Scenario Examples**

These examples simulate end-to-end branded surfaces to ensure that the identity behaves consistently when multiple components interact.

#### **Scenario: Product Launch Micro-Site**

Correct:

* Dark backbone (`--brand-base-900`)
* Accent used strictly for CTAs
* No expressive colour
* Hero image documentary or abstract-technical
* Body text in Plex Sans, 400/500/600
* Diagram colours drawn only from semantic + neutral tokens
* Motion controlled: 100–180ms, ease-out

Incorrect:

* Colour-rich hero image
* Gradient-washed background
* “Launch energy” typography
* Accent used as a dominant background
* Marketing-style motion (elastic, bounce, overshoot)

#### **Scenario: Compliance Evaluation Report (Exported PDF)**

Correct:

* `--brand-surface-0` background
* `--export-text-primary` and `--export-text-secondary`
* Accent used for key progress bars only (`--export-accent-safe`)
* No soft grey backgrounds added for style
* No illustrative fluff
* Everything grid-aligned

Incorrect:

* Decorative front page
* Primary accent used as a background
* Colourful charts
* Typography deviations
* Any expressive styling

#### **Scenario: Event Tabletop Signage**

Correct:

* Neutral base
* Large, factual typography
* Monogram or lockup
* QR code aligned to grid
* Accent used only for micro framing

Incorrect:

* Pattern-heavy backdrops
* Energised marketing gradients
* Emotional photography
* “Booth hype” styling

## 10.1 Usage Rules and Change Control
### 10.1.1 Update Cadence
### 10.1.2 Approval Process

## 10.2 Accessibility Requirements
### 10.2.1 WCAG Conformance
### 10.2.2 Colour and Contrast Constraints

## 10.3 Brand Consistency Audits
### 10.3.1 Audit Checklist
### 10.3.2 Issue Escalation

## 10.4 Versioning and Release Management 

























Below is the full, clean, finalised **Section 10 — Governance and Accessibility**, written in your established voice, fully aligned with the PRD, SAIS, site/blog tone, and the deterministic identity of Transcrypt.
No filler, no drift, no ambiguity.

---

# **10. Governance and Accessibility**

Governance exists to prevent identity drift, enforce correctness, and keep the system stable as Transcrypt evolves.
This section defines how changes are made, how compliance is measured, and how accessibility rules bind every surface — marketing, product, documentation, exports, and third-party integrations.

Nothing in this Brand Identity Guide is optional.
Nothing is subject to interpretation.
Changes require explicit, documented, versioned approval.

Accessibility rules here are non-negotiable system constraints, not design aspirations.
If a proposed visual choice conflicts with accessibility, accessibility wins without debate.

---

## **10.1 Usage Rules and Change Control**

This identity is a *controlled asset*.
Its stability depends on disciplined governance.

### **10.1.1 Update Cadence**

The Brand Identity Guide is updated only under the following conditions:

* A new feature, surface, or capability requires an extension to the visual system.
* A colour, type, or component adjustment is necessary to resolve an accessibility or technical conflict.
* A versioned release requires alignment across PRD, SAIS, PDS, and brand layers.

Cadence:

* **Minor updates** (spelling, clarifications, additional examples): at any time.
* **Patch updates** (token name refinements, accessibility fixes): aligned with sprint cadence.
* **Major updates** (new palette tokens, typeface changes, motion identity changes, grid shifts): allowed only at defined version gates, never ad-hoc.

Every update must be documented in the change log and reflected in the version heading of this document.

### **10.1.2 Approval Process**

Since Transcrypt is developed under a single-owner model, *approval = explicit decision by the project owner*.
However, the process remains formal:

1. Draft change is written in a PRD-style rationale: problem → options → selection → impact.
2. Change is tagged with a semantic version bump.
3. The updated section is committed with a human-readable summary.
4. Appendix A tokens (if relevant) are updated atomically in the same commit.
5. No silent updates are permitted.

This preserves traceability and prevents future ambiguity.

---

## **10.2 Accessibility Requirements**

Accessibility is a first-order system invariant.
Where brand ambition and accessibility collide, accessibility wins.

### **10.2.1 WCAG Conformance**

Transcrypt must conform to:

* **WCAG 2.2 AA** as a baseline
* **AAA** where achievable without compromising clarity or engineering tone

Mandatory rules:

* Minimum text contrast: **4.5:1**
* Large text / UI labels: **3:1**
* Interactive states must have more than colour to signal state (shape, weight, outline).
* Focus states must be clearly visible at all times and must use the cerulean accent token set.
* All type sizes, stroke widths, and spacing rules defined in Sections 5–8 are chosen to meet or exceed WCAG readability targets.

### **10.2.2 Colour and Contrast Constraints**

All colour usage must obey:

* Only colours in **Appendix A** may be used.
* Cerulean accent colours must maintain WCAG AA contrast against both brand surfaces:

  * --brand-base-900
  * --brand-surface-0
* Semantic colours (success, warning, error) must meet contrast rules when used for both text and UI indicators.
* No transparency or overlays that reduce contrast are permitted unless they still meet accessibility thresholds.

No deviations.
No “near misses.”
No aesthetic exceptions.

---

## **10.3 Brand Consistency Audits**

Consistency audits ensure that the brand identity is being applied exactly as designed across all surfaces — website, app, documentation, PDF exports, marketing materials, and internal tools.

### **10.3.1 Audit Checklist**

Every surface must pass the following audit checks:

1. **Colour Usage**

   * All colours used map 1:1 to Appendix A tokens.
   * No gradients or expressive colour blends.
   * Semantic colours used only for their defined purposes.

2. **Typography**

   * IBM Plex Sans only.
   * Only permitted weights.
   * Correct hierarchy and spacing rules.

3. **Iconography**

   * Feather-derived, 24×24 grid, single stroke weight.
   * No fills, no expressive metaphors.
   * Icons stored locally in `/assets/icons/`.

4. **Layout**

   * Official grid implementation only.
   * Spacing unit: 4px scale with correct multipliers.
   * Alignment consistent across breakpoints.

5. **Motion**

   * All transitions 100–180ms.
   * No bounce, elastic, or marketing-style motion.
   * Interaction feedback follows §8.5 rules.

6. **Imagery**

   * Documentary, neutral-tone photography only.
   * No expressive filters, colour washes, cinematic grading.

7. **Exports**

   * PDF-safe token usage only.
   * No decorative elements.
   * Full alignment with the structured hierarchy.

A fail in any category requires remediation before publishing or deployment.

### **10.3.2 Issue Escalation**

When a violation is found:

1. Issue is logged as a **brand inconsistency defect**.
2. The file, component, or asset is flagged in Git.
3. The correction must be applied before the next deploy.
4. If the issue involves a structural rule (grid, typography scale, palette token), it triggers a mandatory review of other surfaces to check for systemic drift.

Repeated violations indicate process defects and must prompt an update to Section 10.1.

---

## **10.4 Versioning and Release Management**

The Brand Identity Guide follows semantic versioning:

* **MAJOR** — structural changes (new grid, new palette, new typeface, new motion rules).
* **MINOR** — new sections, new examples, expanded guidance.
* **PATCH** — clarifications, corrections, non-structural edits.

Release workflow:

1. Every update is tagged with a version ID.
2. `/docs/brand/CHANGELOG.md` receives a timestamped entry.
3. All changes to Appendix A tokens require a version bump, never a silent patch.
4. The version used across:

   * Marketing site
   * App UI
   * PPT templates
   * Documentation site
   * Social and print templates
     must all match the same declared identity version.

Identity cannot fork.
Identity cannot drift.
Identity cannot “update in one place and not the other.”

When a new version is released, all surfaces must migrate within the same sprint unless the version is explicitly marked **non-blocking**.

---

# 11. Asset Delivery

## 11.1 Logo Files

### **11.1.1 File Formats**

All official logo assets must exist in the following formats:

* **SVG (authoritative master format)**
  – logo-primary.svg
  – logo-compact.svg
  – logo-monogram.svg
  – all kept resolution-independent
  – Editable only via vector tools; always scrubbable, no embedded rasters

* **PNG (runtime fallbacks)**
  – 1×, 2×, 3× raster variants
  – Used only where SVG is unsupported (rare)

* **PDF/EPS (print)**
  – Required for physical collateral
  – Always exported directly from the SVG master with no reinterpretation

### **11.1.2 Download Structure**

All logo assets live in the canonical repo location:

```
/assets/logo/
```

With substructure:

```
/assets/logo/svg/
/assets/logo/png/
/assets/logo/print/
```

On build, this folder is published directly to the CDN under a versioned path:

```
https://cdn.transcrypt.io/v{VERSION}/logo/
```

No other location may serve logos.

---

## **11.2 Colour Tokens**

### **11.2.1 Hex and RGB Definitions**

Colour values are defined once, and only once, in:

```
/assets/tokens/colors.json
```

This file contains the full machine-readable mapping of the tokens described in **Appendix A — Colour Tokens and Specifications**.

Example structure (illustrative placeholder):

```json
{
  "brand-base-900": "#020617",
  "brand-base-800": "#0f172a",
  "brand-surface-0": "#ffffff",
  "accent-500": "#3b82f6",
  "success-bg": "#ecfdf5",
  "neutral-500": "#6b7280",
  "export-accent-safe": "#2563eb"
}
```

This file is:

* **the single source of truth**
* consumed by Tailwind, SCSS, product CSS, marketing CSS, and the docs site
* exported to the CDN automatically as:

```
https://cdn.transcrypt.io/v{VERSION}/tokens/colors.json
```

Raw hex values must **never** be inlined in code.

### **11.2.2 Token Naming Rules**

All colour tokens must follow:

* lowercase
* hyphen-separated
* semantic-first naming (e.g., `success-bg`, not `green-light`)
* families grouped with common prefixes (`accent-*`, `neutral-*`, `success-*`, etc.)

No new token may be introduced without updating both:

1. Appendix A
2. `/assets/tokens/colors.json`

Both must change together or the PR is rejected.

---

## **11.3 Typography Files**

### **11.3.1 Licensing Notes**

Transcrypt uses **IBM Plex Sans** (Open Font License).
Permissions are:

* full redistribution
* browser embedding
* modification allowed (though Transcrypt does not modify)
* no closed licensing issues

All fonts must be stored locally; Google Fonts CDN is prohibited due to:

* privacy constraints
* reproducibility requirements
* potential external drift in file versions

### **11.3.2 Webfont Bundles**

The following files must exist in:

```
/assets/type/ibm-plex-sans/
```

* `.woff2` (authoritative)
* `.woff`
* `.ttf` (fallback for legacy documents)
* `font-face.css` (auto-generated mapping)

CDN output:

```
https://cdn.transcrypt.io/v{VERSION}/type/ibm-plex-sans/ibm-plex-sans.woff2
```

All product and marketing surfaces must import from the CDN, never from the repo directly.

---

## **11.4 CDN Delivery Rules**

This subsection is mandatory and completes the asset delivery system.
It defines exactly how assets leave the repo and become globally consumable.

### **11.4.1 Versioned CDN Namespace**

Every release produces a CDN folder:

```
https://cdn.transcrypt.io/v{MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH}/
```

This folder contains:

```
/logo/
/tokens/
/type/
/icons/
/patterns/
/templates/
```

Nothing may be published to `latest/` without explicit approval under §10.1.2.

### **11.4.2 Immutability**

Once a version is published:

* assets cannot be overwritten
* assets cannot be deleted
* assets cannot change checksum

If a correction is required:

* bump the version
* publish a new folder
* reference the updated paths

### **11.4.3 Delivery Format Requirements**

Every published version must include:

* raw assets (SVG, PNG, JSON, etc.)
* minified bundles (CSS/SCSS/Tailwind flavour)
* browser-consumable variants (e.g., `tokens.css`)
* integrity hashes (.sha256)
* a manifest file describing contents and checksums:

```
manifest.json
```

Manifest example:

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "generatedAt": "2025-11-22T12:40:05Z",
  "assets": {
    "logo-primary.svg": "sha256-XYZ…",
    "colors.json": "sha256-ABC…",
    "ibm-plex-sans.woff2": "sha256-123…"
  }
}
```

### **11.4.4 Consumption Rules**

All consuming environments must reference CDN assets:

Marketing site

```
<link rel="preload" href="https://cdn.transcrypt.io/v1.2.0/type/ibm-plex-sans.woff2" as="font">
```

Product UI

```
@import url("https://cdn.transcrypt.io/v1.2.0/tokens/tokens.css");
```

Docs site

```
<img src="https://cdn.transcrypt.io/v1.2.0/logo/logo-monogram.svg">
```

Exports

```
assets: "https://cdn.transcrypt.io/v1.2.0/"
```

### **11.4.5 No Unversioned Consumption**

Absolute prohibition:

* no `/latest/` unless explicitly approved
* no raw GitHub repo links
* no local asset references in production
* no base64 inline fonts
* no bundler pipelines that re-encode assets

### **11.4.6 Local Dev Mirroring**

Local development uses a mirrored structure:

```
/public/cdn-mirror/v{VERSION}/
```

The dev server rewrites CDN URLs to local files to guarantee parity with production.

---

## **11.5 Icon Delivery**

Icons stored at:

```
/assets/icons/
```

Published to:

```
https://cdn.transcrypt.io/v{VERSION}/icons/
```

Rules:

* only 24×24 SVGs
* no inline styles
* stroke colour via tokens
* all icons checksum-stable
* no CDNs external to Transcrypt

---

## **11.6 Pattern and Template Delivery**

Patterns (background SVGs, grids, noise fields) stored at:

```
/assets/patterns/
```

Published to:

```
https://cdn.transcrypt.io/v{VERSION}/patterns/
```

Templates (slide decks, social media layouts, PDF cover sheets) stored at:

```
/assets/templates/
```

Published to:

```
https://cdn.transcrypt.io/v{VERSION}/templates/
```

---

## **11.7 Prohibited Delivery Methods**

The following are forbidden:

* unversioned assets
* GitHub raw URLs
* Google Fonts or any third-party font CDN
* image compression tools that alter checksum
* AI-generated vector output unless manually cleaned
* embedding assets directly into React components
* importing SVGs as code (e.g., svgr) for brand assets
* Tailwind `@apply` that inlines colour values

All assets must remain token-driven, CDN-served, version-stamped.

---

## 11.4 Icon and Illustration Files

Transcrypt uses Feather Icons (MIT licensed) as the sole icon source. Icons are added to the repository as needed and stored as standalone SVG files.

### 11.4.1 Icons

All icons used in the product or marketing materials must be saved in:

/assets/icons/

There is no predefined icon inventory. Icons are added on demand and should be selected from the Feather set unless a custom metaphor is required.

Rules:
- Use outline Feather icons (24×24 grid).
- Make small stroke/geometry adjustments only when required for clarity.
- Do not mix icon sets.
- Store each SVG in the repo; do not import from CDNs or packages at runtime.

### 11.4.2 Illustrations

Any custom illustrations or diagrams used in the product or documentation must be stored in:

/assets/illustrations/

Illustrations follow the style rules defined in Section 6 but do not require versioning or formal governance in a single-designer workflow.

# 12. Legal, Localisation, and Brand Protection

Transcrypt’s brand is an operational asset, not an aesthetic accessory.
This section defines the legal, linguistic, and rights-management constraints that govern how the brand is represented, referenced, and co-presented across all markets and surfaces. Every rule here is enforceable and non-optional.

Brand protection operates on three fronts:

1. **Legal integrity** — trademarks, copyrights, licensing, and usage boundaries.
2. **Territorial correctness** — language, spelling, formats, and market-specific adjustments.
3. **Rights compliance** — photography, likeness, attribution, and restrictions on third-party materials.

All usage across marketing, product, documentation, sales, training, and external partnerships must comply with this section.
Any violation is treated as a brand contamination event and must be remediated under §12.6.

---

## **12.1 Trademark and Copyright Usage**

Transcrypt maintains copyright over:

* all logo assets
* all proprietary illustrations
* all system patterns and product UI
* all written documentation, guides, and marketing content
* all system-generated diagrams and exports
* the full identity system defined in this document

Trademarks include:

* **Transcrypt** (word mark)
* the **Transcrypt Monogram** (the “TC” symbol)
* the **Transcrypt Logotype** (full wordmark)

Rules:

* Do **not** alter, rotate, distort, recolour, crop, animate, or rebuild the logo.
* Do **not** recreate typography resembling the logotype.
* Do **not** create derivatives of the monogram.
* Do **not** pair Transcrypt marks with unapproved corporate marks without written approval under §12.2.

Copyright notices must appear at the footer of all:

* PDFs
* slide decks
* whitepapers
* downloadable templates
* long-form pages on the marketing site

Legal line:

```
© {YEAR} Transcrypt. All rights reserved.
```

---

## **12.2 Third-Party and Co-Branding Rules**

Co-branding is rare and tightly controlled.
Transcrypt may only appear alongside another brand when:

1. There is a formal partnership agreement.
2. Both parties approve the asset.
3. The final layout is reviewed for visual hierarchy and legal compliance.

Rules:

* Transcrypt’s mark must **never** be visually subordinate.
* Spacing must follow §3.3 Clearspace and Minimum Size.
* The Transcrypt accent colour may not be used by the partner brand.
* Partner colours may not recolour Transcrypt assets.
* No marketing pattern may wrap around or interfere with partner marks.
* The monogram may not appear inside another brand’s geometry.
* No “sponsored by” positioning unless contractually required.

All co-branded materials must be archived in:

```
/legal/approvals/co-branding/
```

and stored with timestamps, signatures, and source files.

---

## **12.3 Localisation Guidelines**

Transcrypt will operate in multiple markets.
Localisation is functional, not expressive.

Rules:

* **No rebuilding the logo** for local scripts.
* **No replacing “Transcrypt”** with phonetic approximations.
* **No local colour variations** — palette is global.
* **No adjusted spacing** to fit right-to-left scripts; use approved RTL versions only.
* **Typography** remains IBM Plex Sans globally.

Localisation may adjust only:

* language
* date/time formats
* numerical grouping
* legal disclaimers
* region-specific regulatory references

Examples:

* UK vs US spelling is allowed in content only, not UI component names.
* “Cyber Essentials” vs “NIS2” may vary by region.

Any market-specific microsite must use the global layout, typography, colour tokens, and CDN-delivered identity assets.
No local creative deviations.

---

## **12.4 Photography and Image Rights**

Photography must comply with:

* licensing terms
* identifiable-person rights
* location restrictions
* model clearances
* contributor attribution where applicable

Rules:

* Only legally obtained photography may be used.
* Free-license images must have licence checks stored under `/legal/image-rights/`.
* Paid images must include invoice and licence terms.
* No AI-generated images may include recognisable individuals unless the model grants consent.
* No photography may imply a partnership, certification, affiliation, joint venture, or endorsement.

People depicted in photography may not:

* wear competitor logos
* perform prohibited or unsafe tasks
* appear in misleading technical contexts

Photography rules in §7 apply fully here.

---

## **12.5 Legal Notices in Marketing and Product**

Legal notices must be present in:

* website footer
* product “About” and “Security” pages
* PDF exports
* slide decks
* whitepapers
* rulepack documentation
* any public-facing deliverable

Required fields:

* © YEAR Transcrypt
* Trademark notice (™ / ® depending on jurisdiction)
* Licensing details (for IBM Plex Sans, Feather Icons, etc.)
* Cookie policy link
* Privacy policy link
* Terms of service link

All icons, fonts, and libraries included must list their license in:

```
/legal/licenses/
```

The marketing site must display third-party licences for:

* IBM Plex Sans
* Feather Icons
* any used JS library
* any used CSS tooling
* analytics scripts (if self-hosted, disclose accordingly)

No runtime dependency may be used without a licence check.

---

## **12.6 Prohibited Uses and Violations**

The following are categorically prohibited, regardless of intent:

* Using the logo in political, ideological, or socially divisive contexts
* Using the brand on unsafe, misleading, or fabricated imagery
* Using Transcrypt marks alongside competitor marks
* Modifying or recolouring the logo outside approved tokens
* Using non-CDN assets in public environments
* Altering typography, spacing, or colour tokens
* Representing Transcrypt as a cybersecurity auditor, regulator, or certifier
* Implying formal CE certification unless explicitly stated
* Generating AI images that resemble Transcrypt personnel
* Using the brand in any context implying endorsement of third-party products

Any violation must be logged in:

```
/legal/violations/{YEAR}/
```

with corrective action detailed, timestamped, and committed.

---

# **13. Future Work**

This section outlines areas of the brand system that are intentionally deferred. They are not required for the stability, coherence, or correctness of the current identity. Each represents an extension that will become relevant as Transcrypt’s product surface grows, its marketing channels expand, or new operational needs emerge.
These items should be prioritised as the platform matures, new modules or tiers are introduced, or external demands justify additional identity layers.

Future work items must not be implemented ad-hoc. They require the same rigour, review, and versioning discipline defined in §10.4.

---

## **13.1 Data Visualisation Identity**

Transcrypt will eventually present structured progress indicators, audit-readiness scores, task completion ratios, and other compliance-related metrics.
A dedicated data visualisation identity will be required to define:

* Approved chart types
* Semantic colour mappings
* Minimum contrast and accessibility rules
* Motion restrictions
* Prohibited chart forms
* Structural templates for dashboards and reports

This work is deferred until visualisation becomes part of the product surface.

---

## **13.2 Illustration Scaling and Integration**

The current system defines illustration tone and metaphor. Future expansion will define:

* Scaling rules for mobile, cards, and hero surfaces
* Integration rules with photography
* Responsive behaviour
* Acceptable and prohibited styles for multi-illustration sets

This will be activated when illustration becomes a recurring pattern across marketing and product.

---

## **13.3 Sub-Brand and Tier Architecture**

As Transcrypt adds modules, feature tiers, or related products, a formal sub-brand strategy will be required. This includes:

* Naming conventions
* Colour or accent differentiation
* Typography accents
* Logo or lockup variations (if any)
* Rules preventing brand fragmentation

This will be developed when expansion beyond the Essentials App is planned.

---

## **13.4 Physical Space and Environmental Branding**

When Transcrypt first appears in physical environments — conferences, booths, signage, or printed events — additional guidance will be required for:

* Large-format typography
* Distance legibility
* Banner and backdrop layouts
* Physical material constraints
* Lighting and colour fidelity in real-world spaces

This is deferred until Transcrypt participates in live events.

---

## **13.5 Social Behaviour and Channel Identity**

While core templates exist in §9, a deeper behavioural identity for social channels will be needed as the brand’s public presence grows.
Future work will define:

* Posting tone
* Platform-specific constraints (LinkedIn, X, YouTube, etc.)
* Hashtag rules
* Reactive content guidance
* Image–text balance per channel
* Prohibited topics and formats

This becomes essential when daily or campaign-driven posting begins.

---

## **13.6 Design Tokenisation and Brand API**

As engineering and product UI surface expand, Transcrypt will require a design-token system that expresses:

* Semantic colour tokens
* Typography tokens
* Spacing and rhythm tokens
* Motion tokens
* JSON/CSS variable exports
* Versioned token distribution for developers

This is deferred until UI implementation begins at scale.

---

## **13.7 Brand Drift Detection and Automation**

To maintain long-term integrity, automated checks may be added to detect:

* Outdated logo files
* Deprecated colour values
* Incorrect typography usage
* Token drift in UI code
* Off-brand layouts in shared folders
* Missing attribution in imagery

This future capability extends the governance model in §10 and reinforces Transcrypt’s principle of deterministic brand expression.

---

# Appendix A - Colour Tokens and Specifications

Perfect — we go with **Option A: placeholder tokens only**, fully structured, no hex values yet, no accidental colour commitment.

Here is **Appendix A — Colour Tokens and Specifications**, written exactly as a top-tier brand/engineering organisation would define it: deterministic, implementation-ready, and fully cross-referenced in Section 4.

---

# **Appendix A — Colour Tokens and Specifications**

This appendix defines the authoritative colour tokens used across all Transcrypt surfaces.
These tokens form the implementation layer of the colour system.
They provide the single source of truth for developers, designers, and documentation authors.

Values in this appendix are **placeholders** and intentionally free of numeric colour definitions.
Final hex/RGB/HSL values will be set during visual refinement and swapped into the token definitions without requiring changes to the Brand Identity Guide text.

All references in Section 4 point to this appendix.

---

## **A.1 Primary Palette Tokens**

These tokens represent the core colours of the Transcrypt identity.
Their exact numeric values are defined here and nowhere else.

### **A.1.1 Engineered Base**

* `--brand-base-900`: <deep-engineered-base>
* `--brand-base-800`: <engineered-base-variant>

---

### **A.1.5 Filigree (Industrial Violet)**

These tokens define the optional micro-detail colour used for structural embellishment and metadata.
They must never function as accents or semantic colours.

* `--filigree-violet-50`: <industrial-violet-50>
* `--filigree-violet-100`: <industrial-violet-100>

* architecture diagrams
* PDF gridlines and folio marks
* cover-page detailing for SAIS, PRD, PDS
* premium print filigree

Filigree tokens must not appear in UI, CTAs, semantic states, or charting.

---

## **A.2 Secondary Semantic Tokens**

Secondary colours represent system state.
They must never compete with the accent and must remain consistent across product, documentation, and exports.

### **A.2.1 Success Tokens**

* `--success-bg`: <success-background>
* `--success-border`: <success-border>
* `--success-text`: <success-text>

* `--err-border`: <error-border>
* `--err-text`: <error-text>

Used for:

* failed checks
* invalid evidence
* prohibited actions

---

## **A.3 Neutral Greyscale Tokens**

Transcrypt’s greyscale provides structural hierarchy and spacing in both light and dark environments.

* `--neutral-900`: <deep-neutral>
* `--neutral-800`: <dark-neutral>
* `--neutral-700`: <subtle-dark-neutral>
* `--neutral-600`: <quiet-dark-neutral>

* `--neutral-100`: <structured-neutral>
* `--neutral-50`: <lifted-neutral>

Used for:

* borders
* card chrome
* UI elevation
* diagram scaffolding
* spacing definition

These greys must never be repurposed as accent colours.

---

## **A.4 Print and Export Safe Tokens**

These tokens ensure that PDF exports and printed reports maintain consistent colour reproduction across devices.

* `--export-accent-safe`: <cerulean-print-safe>
* `--export-neutral-safe`: <neutral-print-safe>
* `--export-text-primary`: <text-print-primary>
* `--export-text-secondary`: <text-print-secondary>

Used for:

* offline audit documents
* archival records

---

## **A.5 Token Usage Rules**

1. **No colour may be used unless defined in this appendix.**
2. **No new tokens may be introduced without revising Appendix A.**
3. **All product code, CSS, design files, and illustration exports must reference tokens, not hex values.**
4. **All future rulepacks and features inherit the palette from these tokens.**
5. **Variance (soft/deep) is allowed only for the accent and only within the cerulean family.**
6. **Semantic tones must never be repurposed as brand colours.**

---

# **A.6 Geometry and Elevation Tokens (Fully Defined)**

Geometry tokens define the system-wide rules for corner radii and elevation. These are the only permitted values. No component may invent its own.

All values below are **final numeric definitions**, not placeholders.

---

## **A.6.1 Radius Tokens**

These radii create the engineered, controlled geometry of the Transcrypt system.

### **Radius Tokens — Canonical Values**

* `--radius-none: 0px;`

  * Used for: tables, strict technical blocks, diagrams, structural containers.

* `--radius-tight: 4px;`

  * Used for: inputs, dropdowns, small UI controls, secondary buttons.
  * Keeps things crisp without looking hostile.

* `--radius-card: 12px;`

  * Used for: cards, panels, modals, grouped surfaces.
  * This matches the curvature used in your colour-token demo.
  * Strongly contributes to the “engineered, not friendly” aesthetic.

* `--radius-pill: 999px;`

  * Used for: pills, status chips, tags.
  * Explicitly full-rounding; ensures a clean ellipse regardless of width.

**System Rules**

1. Components must choose from the above; no custom radii.
2. Cards *must* use `--radius-card` unless explicitly square (`--radius-none`).
3. No intermediate radii (6px, 8px, 10px) may be introduced—this prevents style drift.
4. Icons and illustrations that include rounded shapes must align to these values (i.e., 0px, 4px, or pill-level).

---

## **A.6.2 Shadow Tokens**

Shadows in Transcrypt are ultra-controlled: no theatrics, no long spreads, no coloured glows. Only just enough elevation to separate layers.

### **Shadow Tokens — Canonical Values**

* `--shadow-none: none;`

  * For: strict data surfaces, tables, flat layout elements.

* `--shadow-subtle: 0 1px 3px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.12);`

  * Matches your demo exactly.
  * Used for: small cards, light UI elevation, inline groupings.

* `--shadow-soft: 0 12px 30px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.18);`

  * From your HTML demo: deeper but still disciplined.
  * Used for: modals, primary panels, major grouped information blocks.

**System Rules**

1. No inline `box-shadow`; all shadows must reference tokens.
2. Shadows may not stack or layer.
3. Shadow colours must always use the neutral deep base (`rgba(15,23,42,*)`).
4. Dark-mode elevation may use light contrast shifts, but the token names remain the same.
5. Shadows are **never** semantic indicators—state is handled only by colour tokens.

---

# **A.7 Typography Tokens**

Typography tokens define the canonical font stacks for Transcrypt. These tokens are the only permitted way to reference fonts in CSS, app code, or exported documents.

### **A.7.1 Sans-Serif Primary Typeface**

```
--font-sans: "IBM Plex Sans", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont,
             "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
```

Used for:

* all body text
* all headings
* all UI chrome
* all product surfaces
* all marketing surfaces
* PDF exports (where supported; otherwise mapped to the closest fallback)

### **A.7.2 Mono Typeface (Code / Technical)**

You implicitly used a mono stack in your demo, so we formalise that too:

```
--font-mono: "IBM Plex Mono", ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular,
             Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", "Courier New",
             monospace;
```

Used for:

* code fragments
* inline technical identifiers
* tokens
* system logs
* architectural diagrams

---

# Appendix B — Spacing Tokens and Specifications

This appendix defines the authoritative spacing tokens used across all Transcrypt surfaces.  
All layout, rhythm, and component spacing must be expressed using these tokens.

## B.1 Base Unit

- `--space-unit`: 4px

All other spacing tokens are integer multiples of this base unit.

## B.2 Section Spacing

- `--space-section-xl`: 120px  # 30 × base
- `--space-section-l`:  96px   # 24 × base
- `--space-section-m`:  72px   # 18 × base
- `--space-section-s`:  56px   # 14 × base

Used for: page-level breaks, major section dividers.

## B.3 Block Spacing

- `--space-block-l`: 40px  # 10 × base
- `--space-block-m`: 32px  # 8 × base
- `--space-block-s`: 24px  # 6 × base

Used for: spacing between stacked content blocks (cards, groups, form sections).

## B.4 Element Spacing

- `--space-element-l`:   20px  # 5 × base
- `--space-element-m`:   16px  # 4 × base
- `--space-element-s`:   12px  # 3 × base
- `--space-element-xs`:  8px   # 2 × base
- `--space-element-xxs`: 4px   # 1 × base

Used for: spacing between labels and inputs, list items, chip stacks, micro-elements.

## B.5 Usage Rules

1. All spacing in product, marketing, and documentation must map to these tokens.
2. No ad-hoc pixel values may be introduced in layout CSS.
3. Tailwind / CSS implementations must consume these tokens, not redefine new spacing scales.
4. Any change to these values is a versioned change and must be recorded under §10.4.

---

# **Document Governance**

This section defines the governance, control, and compliance obligations that apply to this document. It exists to ensure alignment across the quadrumvirate (PRD, SAIS, PDS, BIG) and to record all governance outcomes arising from the multi-document compliance audit.

## **1. Governance Purpose**

This document operates under the same structural discipline as the PRD, SAIS, and PDS. Its purpose is to preserve consistency, prevent drift, and ensure the brand identity system remains aligned with:

* strategic intent defined in the PRD
* architectural invariants defined in the SAIS
* behavioural and interface constraints defined in the PDS

No part of this document may override or contradict higher-order requirements.

---

## **2. Mandatory Compliance Outcomes**

The following governance outcomes were identified during the cross-document audit. They are now formal constraints:

### **2.1 Colour System Governance**

* Brand colours must be explicitly divided into:

  * **Marketing-only colours**
  * **Mapped colours** that correspond to PDS semantic tokens
* No brand colour may implicitly enter the product surface without a PDS token.

### **2.2 Typography Boundary Governance**

* BIG typography rules govern **marketing surfaces only**.
* Product typography is governed exclusively by the PDS.
* No font, weight, or style introduced here may leak into application runtimes.

### **2.3 Logo Geometry & Spacing Governance**

* Logo clearspace rules must not conflict with the PDS spacing system.
* BIG spacing values must be interpreted as *brand-layer* rules only.
* Application spacing and layout remain the domain of PDS tokens.

### **2.4 Motion Governance**

* Motion guidance in BIG is restricted to **marketing-only** surfaces.
* All in-product motion is governed by the prohibitions and constraints of the PDS.
* No motion defined here may be applied to authenticated surfaces.

### **2.5 Imagery Governance**

* Brand imagery must comply with PDS accessibility, contrast, and clarity principles.
* Metaphorical, abstract, or low-contrast photography may not appear inside the product unless explicitly authorised by the PDS.
* BIG must define constrained imagery rules to prevent aesthetic drift.

---

## **3. Structural Omissions Requiring Inclusion**

The following required sections must be added to this document to achieve full governance compliance:

### **3.1 Brand Asset Delivery & CDN Rules**

Must specify:

* filename hashing
* versioned asset paths
* immutability guarantees
* CDN caching and invalidation
* staging ↔ prod alignment
* SSR/ISR propagation rules

### **3.2 SEO & Editorial Identity Layer**

Must specify:

* canonical structure
* metadata and authorship rules
* keyword strategy constraints
* structured data usage
* ALT text taxonomy
* content integrity and editorial discipline

### **3.3 Brand Protection & Legal Usage**

Must specify:

* trademark usage
* co-branding rules
* prohibited distortions
* unacceptable recolours
* asset misuse boundaries

### **3.4 High-Contrast & Failure-Mode Brand Behaviour**

Must specify fallback behaviour for:

* logo
* typography
* colour
* imagery
* offline operation

### **3.5 Marketing Typography Declaration**

Must specify:

* marketing font families
* weights
* usage hierarchy
* explicit prohibition on crossing into product runtime

### **3.6 Marketing-Only Motion Identity**

Must specify:

* permissible motion
* velocity, easing, and rhythm
* forbidden transitions
* strict separation from in-product motion constraints

---

## **4. Overreach Controls**

The following constraints ensure that BIG does not encroach into SAIS/PDS territory:

* No layout rules for authenticated surfaces may appear in this document.
* No product-level component behaviour may be implied or described.
* No architecture, asset-bundling logic, or responsive breakpoints may be defined here unless strictly branding-layer.
* Any technical statement that alters runtime behaviour must be moved to SAIS.

---

## **5. Traceability Requirements**

This document must include explicit cross-references to:

* PRD §§1–3 for purpose, audience, identity principles
* PDS §§6–7 for spacing, geometry, elevation, tokens
* SAIS §§2–3 for runtime delivery, asset integrity, caching
* PRD §11 for acceptance and operational discipline

Every brand rule must trace either:

* upward into PRD intent, or
* laterally into PDS/SAIS constraints, depending on domain.

---

## **6. Acceptance Criteria**

This document is considered compliant only if:

1. All required sections listed in §3 are implemented.
2. All conflicts identified in §2 are resolved.
3. All overreach items in §4 are removed or rewritten.
4. Cross-reference anchors in §5 are added.
5. This document expresses **marketing identity only** and introduces zero product-behaviour or runtime-governance content.
6. The document can be version-pinned and used within deterministic build pipelines.

---

## **7. Revision Cadence**

* Major: upon any substantive change to PRD, SAIS, or PDS
* Minor: upon addition of brand assets, new marketing templates, or SEO rules
* Quarterly: standard governance review
* Every version must be Git-tagged and cross-referenced to corresponding PRD/PDS/SAIS versions
